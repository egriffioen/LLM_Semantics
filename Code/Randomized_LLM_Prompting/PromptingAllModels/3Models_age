It would be interesting to further validate this finding with a larger dataset for better accuracy.",16-17,14-15
mistral:7b,0,The Stowaway (Christian Heritage: The Salem Years #2),"Based on the emotion vector analysis of the book description for ""The Stowaway (Christian Heritage: The Salem Years #2)"", it appears that the book has a high level of Anger, Fear, and Sadness, along with some Anticipation, Disgust, Joy, and Trust.

Comparing this to the emotion vectors of each age group:
1. 12-13: The values for Anger, Fear, and Sadness are relatively close, but there's a bit more emphasis on Joy and Anticipation in the teenage age group.
2. 14-15: This age group has higher levels of Anger, Fear, and Sadness than the 12-13 group, but it also has a slightly higher level of Joy and Anticipation.
3. 16-17: This age group has the highest levels of all the emotions compared to the other groups, making it a close match for ""The Stowaway (Christian Heritage: The Salem Years #2)"".
4. 18+: Although there's still a relatively high emphasis on Anger, Fear, and Sadness in this group, the levels of Joy and Anticipation are lower compared to the other three age groups.
