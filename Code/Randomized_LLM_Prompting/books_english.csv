The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for ""social"") has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy's skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.",4.1,16.272727272727273,,,"{'Anger': 0.10500193685841566, 'Anticipation': 0.12052101491380976, 'Disgust': 0.050188843695525856, 'Fear': 0.13802537284524502, 'Joy': 0.12611369358899863, 'Sadness': 0.1219010265349603, 'Surprise': 0.04992252566337401, 'Trust': 0.2883255858996708}",en

Doyle transmogrified the legend: generations ago, a hound of hell tore out the throat of devilish Hugo Baskerville on the moonlit moor. Poor, accursed Baskerville Hall now has another mysterious death: that of Sir Charles Baskerville. Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore, history-obsessed Dr. Frankland, butterfly-chasing Stapleton, or Selden, the Notting Hill murderer at large?

What distinguishes this particular <i>Hound</i> is its fulfillment of Doyle's great debt to Edgar Allan Poe--it's full of ancient woe, low moans, a Grimpen Mire that sucks ponies to Dostoyevskian deaths, and locals digging up Neolithic skulls without next-of-kins' consent. ""The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul,"" Watson realizes.

With a tremendous cracking and splintering of oak, it struck the ship just beneath the anchor secured at the cat-head on the port bow..."" <br /><br /><i>In the Heart of the Sea</i> brings to new life the incredible story of the wreck of the whaleship Essex - an event as mythic in its own century as the Titanic disaster in ours, and the inspiration for the climax of Moby-Dick. In a harrowing page-turner, Nathaniel Philbrick restores this epic story to its rightful place in American history.<br /><br />In 1820, the 240-ton Essex set sail from Nantucket on a routine voyage for whales. Fifteen months later, in the farthest reaches of the South Pacific, it was repeatedly rammed and sunk by an eighty-ton bull sperm whale. Its twenty-man crew, fearing cannibals on the islands to the west, made for the 3,000-mile-distant coast of South America in three tiny boats. During ninety days at sea under horrendous conditions, the survivors clung to life as one by one, they succumbed to hunger, thirst, disease, and fear.<br /><br />Philbrick interweaves his account of this extraordinary ordeal of ordinary men with a wealth of whale lore and with a brilliantly detailed portrait of the lost, unique community of Nantucket whalers. Impeccably researched and beautifully told, the book delivers the ultimate portrait of man against nature, drawing on a remarkable range of archival and modern sources, including a long-lost account by the ship's cabin boy.<br /><br />At once a literary companion and a page-turner that speaks to the same issues of class, race, and man's relationship to nature that permeate the works of Melville, <i>In the Heart of the Sea</i> will endure as a vital work of American history.",4.15,17.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.12451348465539214, 'Anticipation': 0.12137912031136981, 'Disgust': 0.07748079771294733, 'Fear': 0.16984121516894568, 'Joy': 0.14765955981124926, 'Sadness': 0.11438707677470467, 'Surprise': 0.10670616195363895, 'Trust': 0.13803258361175214}",en

This tight-knit and deeply connected family, where a death of one strengthens the others with his/her knowledge. One Mayfair witch per generation is also designated to receive the powers of ""the man,"" known as Lasher. Lasher gives the witches gifts, excites them, and protects them. Unsure as to exactly what this spirit is, the Mayfair clan knows him variously as a protector, a god-like figure, a sexual being, and the image of death. Lasher's current witch is Deirdre, who lies catatonic from psycological shock treatments.<br /><br />Deirdre's daughter, Rowan, has been spirited away from this ""evil"" and has happily become a neurosurgeon and has an uncanny gift to see the intent behind the facade. Rowan also has a gift few doctors possess--she can heal cells. Yet, though she uses it to save lives, she also fears that she hs caused several deaths. She rescues Michael from drowning. Michael then develops some extraordinary powers that compel him to seek New Orleans and to seek Rowan. He finds both, and pulls the tale closer together by meeting people connected to the Mayfair family who now fear Rowan because she is the first Mayfair who can kill without Lasher's help.<br /><br />Michael dives into learning the history of the Mayfair witches: Deborah, Charlotte, Mary Beth, Stella, Antha, and many others across hundreds of years and three continents. When Michael looks up from his reading, he learns that Rowan has come to New Orleans to attend her mother's funeral. Rowan learns of her family history, her ancestral home in shambles, and Lasher waiting for the next one. Rowan dedicates herself to stopping Lasher's reign. Michael too has his own mission, but it is foggy and unclear to him.

756,756,9780553240634,922193,The Right Stuff,[Tom Wolfe],"Tom Wolfe began <i>The Right Stuff</i> at a time when it was unfashionable to contemplate American heroism. Nixon had left the White House in disgrace, the nation was reeling from the catastrophe of Vietnam, and in 1979--the year the book appeared--Americans were being held hostage by Iranian militants. Yet it was exactly the anachronistic courage of his subjects that captivated Wolfe. In his foreword, he notes that as late as 1970, almost one in four career Navy pilots died in accidents. ""<i>The Right Stuff</i>,"" he explains, ""became a story of why men were willing--willing?--delighted!--to take on such odds in this, an era literary people had long since characterized as the age of the anti-hero."" <p> Wolfe's roots in New Journalism were intertwined with the nonfiction novel that Truman Capote had pioneered with <i>In Cold Blood</i>. As Capote did, Wolfe tells his story from a limited omniscient perspective, dropping into the lives of his ""characters"" as each in turn becomes a major player in the space program. After an opening chapter on the terror of being a test pilot's wife, the story cuts back to the late 1940s, when Americans were first attempting to break the sound barrier. Test pilots, we discover, are people who live fast lives with dangerous machines, not all of them airborne. Chuck Yeager was certainly among the fastest, and his determination to push through Mach 1--a feat that some had predicted would cause the destruction of any aircraft--makes him the book's guiding spirit.</p><p> Yet soon the focus shifts to the seven initial astronauts. Wolfe traces Alan Shepard's suborbital flight and Gus Grissom's embarrassing panic on the high seas (making the controversial claim that Grissom flooded his Liberty capsule by blowing the escape hatch too soon). The author also produces an admiring portrait of John Glenn's apple-pie heroism and selfless dedication. By the time Wolfe concludes with a return to Yeager and his late-career exploits, the narrative's epic proportions and literary merits are secure. Certainly <i>The Right Stuff</i> is the best, the funniest, and the most vivid book ever written about America's manned space program. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>",4.23,19.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.062108620588751676, 'Anticipation': 0.19434365306958507, 'Disgust': 0.02709662316380874, 'Fear': 0.14038450283841516, 'Joy': 0.12189091121905539, 'Sadness': 0.1012611927196114, 'Surprise': 0.10652835488968222, 'Trust': 0.2463861415110903}",en

Late in the afternoon of Sunday, October 3 1993, 140 elite US Soldiers abseiled from helicopters into a teeming market neighbourhood in the heart of the city. Their mission was to abduct two top lieutenants of a Somali warlord and return to base. It was supposed to take them about an hour.<br /><br />Instead, they were pinned down through a long and terrible night in a hostile city, fighting for their lives against thousands of heavily armed Somalis. Two of their high-tech helicopters were shot out of the sky. When the unit was rescued the following morning, eighteen American soldiers were dead and more than seventy badly injured. The Somali toll was far worse - more than five hundred killed and over a thousand injured.<br /><br />Authoritative, gripping, and insightful, Black Hawk Down is destined to become a classic of war reporting.

When the two are sold into Midnight, Turquoise is given to the realm's protective master, Jaguar. But while Turquoise moves closer to him and looks for the right time to complete her assignment, she unexpectedly comes face-to-face with a horrific part of her past -- Lord Daryl, an evil vampire who killed her family and was once her master.

The first comprises: Herself Surprised, To Be a Pilgrim and The Horse's Mouth. The Horse's Mouth is a portrait of an artistic temperament. Its principal character, Gulley Gimson, is an impoverished painter who scorns conventional good behaviour. He may be a bad citizen, but he is a good artist, so wholly preoccupied with his art that he is willing to endure any privation for its sake. Such is his contempt for orthodox mores, he takes a delight in cocking a snook at them. For him there is only one morality: to be a painter. 'Mr Joyce Cary is an important and exciting writer; there's no doubt about that. To use Tennyson's phrase, he is a Lord of Language ... if you like rich writing full of gusto and accurate original character drawing, you will get it from The Horse's Mouth.'

2512,2512,9780679452355,2018856,Still Me,[Christopher Reeve],"Christopher Reeve has beaten the odds before. He scored his first role in a Euripides play at 15, costarred with Katharine Hepburn at 22, and was one of two advanced-program students accepted at Juilliard, to which 2,000 drama students annually apply. (The other advanced student became his best friend, Robin Williams.) Reeve rode a sailplane to 32,000 feet over Pikes Peak, fell 90 feet from a parasail harness into four feet of water and walked away. He survived emergency appendectomy, malaria in Kenya, and the disastrous film <i>Changing Channels</i>, with Burt Reynolds. He flew vintage airplanes upside down. On his first solo transatlantic flight, a radar controller informed him he was about to run out of gas 200 miles west of Iceland. The radar controller had misread his screen, and Reeve landed safely.<p> Then, in 1995, his horse balked at a 3-foot-3-inch racecourse fence, made an abrupt ""dirty stop,"" Reeve's hands got tangled in the reins, he landed on his head and got a ""hangman's injury""--a broken neck. Ace paramedics got oxygen to him 60 seconds before brain damage set in, and a helicopter named Pegasus lofted him to a hospital.</p><p> Reeve was already important. His interpretation of <i>Superman</i> was classic, and his starring role in <i>The Bostonians</i> launched the Merchant/Ivory school of filmmaking. But it was not until his paralysis that Reeve really got moving as a public figure of the first rank. As his memoir <i>Still Me</i> details, since the accident, Reeve has directed his first film, started the Christopher Reeve Foundation to fund spinal-cord-repair research, lobbied Congress, and crisscrossed the country on speaking engagements.</p><p> Says Reeve, ""Lindbergh made it across the Atlantic [where he was feted by Reeve's grandma]; Houdini got out of those straitjackets; with enough money and grass-roots support, why shouldn't I be able to get out of this wheelchair?"" Part Hollywood reminiscence, part scientific detective story, and part soapbox speech, <i>Still Me</i> explains the tantalizing but quite real possiblity that Reeve (and a quarter-million other paralyzed people, plus 49 million disabled Americans) may get back on their feet. Bobby Kennedy once tried to bolster Reeve's faith by saying, ""Just fake it till you make it. The prayers will seem phony, but one day they'll become real."" Christopher Reeve has more than a prayer, he has a program. He ain't fake, and he just might make it, leading a cast of millions. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>",4.09,19.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.08100235425561629, 'Anticipation': 0.1674181663407951, 'Disgust': 0.048149182660973885, 'Fear': 0.15471582671614595, 'Joy': 0.09178936727717701, 'Sadness': 0.13306199539789582, 'Surprise': 0.07315483553462883, 'Trust': 0.25070827181676714}",en

2676,2676,9780425051818,7683125,Theory/practice Hell,[Eugen Kogon],"By the spring of 1945, the Second World War was drawing to a close in Europe. Allied troops were sweeping through Nazi Germany and discovering the atrocities of SS concentration camps. The first to be reached intact was Buchenwald, in central Germany. American soldiers struggled to make sense of the shocking scenes they witnessed inside. They asked a small group of former inmates to draft a report on the camp. It was led by Eugen Kogon, a German political prisoner who had been an inmate since 1939. <i>The Theory and Practice of Hell</i> is his classic account of life inside.<br /><br />Unlike many other books by survivors who published immediately after the war, <i>The Theory and Practice of Hell</i> is more than a personal account. It is a horrific examination of life and death inside a Nazi concentration camp, a brutal world of a state within state, and a society without law. But Kogon maintains a dispassionate and critical perspective. He tries to understand how the camp works, to uncover its structure and social organization. He knew that the book would shock some readers and provide others with gruesome fascination. But he firmly believed that he had to show the camp in honest, unflinching detail.<br /><br />The result is a unique historical document—a complete picture of the society, morality, and politics that fueled the systematic torture of six million human beings. For many years, <i>The Theory and Practice of Hell</i> remained the seminal work on the concentration camps, particularly in Germany.

3092,3092,9780385333467,1050460,His Bright Light,[Danielle Steel],"""This is the story of an extraordinary boy with a brilliant mind, a heart of gold, and a tortured soul. It is the story of an illness, a fight to live, and a race against death.""<br /><br />From the day he was born, Nick Traina was his mother's joy. By nineteen, he was dead. This is Danielle Steel's powerful personal story of the son she lost and the lessons she learned during his courageous battle against darkness. Sharing tender, painful memories and Nick's remarkable journals, Steel brings us a haunting duet between a singular young man and the mother who loved him--and a harrowing portrait of a masked killer called manic depression, which afflicts between two and three million Americans.<br /><br />Nick rocketed through life like a shooting star. Signs of his illness were subtle, often paradoxical. He spoke in full sentences at age one. He was a brilliant, charming child who never slept. And at first, even his mother explained away his quicksilver moods. Nick always marched to a different drummer. His gift for writing was extraordinary, his musical talent promised a golden future. But by the time he entered junior high, Danielle Steel saw her beloved son hurtling toward disaster and tried desperately to get Nick the help he needed--the opening salvos of what would become a ferocious pitched battle for his life.<br /><br />Even as he struggled, Nick's charisma and accomplishments remained undimmed. He bared his soul in his journal with uncanny insight, in searing prose, poetry, and song. When he was finally diagnosed and treated, it bought time, but too little. In the end, perhaps nothing could have saved him from the insidious disease that had shadowed him from his earliest years.<br /><br />At once a loving legacy and an unsparing depiction of a devastating illness, Danielle Steel's tribute to her lost son is a gift of life, hope, healing, and understanding to us all.",4.15,17.0,"{'Anger': 0.054214997005921625, 'Anticipation': 0.06167801459335979, 'Disgust': 0.03413249351283018, 'Fear': 0.0975681430060547, 'Joy': 0.09904300383685596, 'Sadness': 0.07465235423273968, 'Surprise': 0.02837166492936193, 'Trust': 0.10122757213511055, 'Objective': 0.4491117567477655}","{'Anger': 0.0636045854109906, 'Anticipation': 0.06882743021641906, 'Disgust': 0.036302883873952606, 'Fear': 0.09841155605819153, 'Joy': 0.10058088726674548, 'Sadness': 0.07668740040096643, 'Surprise': 0.03321338611011155, 'Trust': 0.10598365290700663, 'Objective': 0.4163882177556161}","{'Anger': 0.11176045524342879, 'Anticipation': 0.11021587932436093, 'Disgust': 0.06378827567518744, 'Fear': 0.17292024207388673, 'Joy': 0.1658657754493722, 'Sadness': 0.13474844187516935, 'Surprise': 0.05447565712221118, 'Trust': 0.18622527323638335}",en

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.<br /><br />But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.<br /><br />Source: hatrack.com",4.3,16.842105263157894,"{'Anger': 0.04573751850852005, 'Anticipation': 0.07742901317888434, 'Disgust': 0.023134627498138924, 'Fear': 0.08452155986943825, 'Joy': 0.03521731661226593, 'Sadness': 0.034906455280961375, 'Surprise': 0.01009481270604789, 'Trust': 0.04269434968627548, 'Objective': 0.6462643466594679}","{'Anger': 0.05008894732771289, 'Anticipation': 0.08633304973315802, 'Disgust': 0.022538479387423625, 'Fear': 0.08293758217959628, 'Joy': 0.040908036197695105, 'Sadness': 0.034565705004254, 'Surprise': 0.0159486425864336, 'Trust': 0.05565008894732772, 'Objective': 0.6110294686363988}","{'Anger': 0.13029132464187992, 'Anticipation': 0.2245694511508128, 'Disgust': 0.058627072267825535, 'Fear': 0.21573716401094487, 'Joy': 0.10640994688556253, 'Sadness': 0.08991228070175437, 'Surprise': 0.04148559472074682, 'Trust': 0.1329671656204732}",en

3683,3683,9780312868604,267773,Ender's Shadow,[Orson Scott Card],"<i>Ender's Shadow</i> is being dubbed as a parallel novel to Orson Scott Card's Hugo and Nebula Award-winning <i>Ender's Game</i>. By ""parallel,"" Card means that <i>Shadow</i> begins and ends at roughly the same time as <i>Game</i>, and it chronicles many of the same events. In fact, the two books tell an almost identical story of brilliant children being trained in the orbiting Battle School to lead humanity's fleets in the final war against alien invaders known as the Buggers. The most brilliant of these young recruits is Ender Wiggin, an unparalleled commander and tactician who can surely defeat the Buggers if only he can overcome his own inner turmoil. <p> Second among the children is Bean, who becomes Ender's lieutenant despite the fact that he is the smallest and youngest of the Battle School students. Bean is the central character of <i>Shadow</i>, and we pick up his story when he is just a 2-year-old starving on the streets of a future Rotterdam that has become a hell on earth. Bean is unnaturally intelligent for his age, which is the only thing that allows him to escape--though not unscathed--the streets and eventually end up in Battle School. Despite his brilliance, however, Bean is doomed to live his life as an also-ran to the more famous and in many ways more brilliant Ender. Nonetheless, Bean learns things that Ender cannot or will not understand, and it falls to this once pathetic street urchin to carry the weight of a terrible burden that Ender must not be allowed to know.</p><p> Although it may seem like <i>Shadow</i> is merely an attempt by Card to cash in on the success of his justly famous <i>Ender's Game</i>, that suspicion will dissipate once you turn the first few pages of this engrossing novel. It's clear that Bean has a story worth telling, and that Card (who started the project with a cowriter but later decided he wanted it all to himself) is driven to tell it. And though much of <i>Ender's Game</i> hinges on a surprise ending that Card fans are likely well acquainted with, <i>Shadow</i> manages to capitalize on that same surprise and even turn the table on readers. In the end, it seems a shame that <i>Shadow</i>, like Bean himself, will forever be eclipsed by the myth of Ender, because this is a novel that can easily stand on its own. Luckily for readers, Card has left plenty of room for a sequel, so we may well be seeing more of Bean in the near future. <i>--Craig E.

Yamata's motivation lies in his desire to pay off a Debt of Honor to his parents and to the country he feels is responsible for their deaths: America.

When the faulty gas tank on one Tennessee family's car leads to their fiery death, an opportunistic U.S. congressman uses the occasion to rush a new trade law through the system.

She's Stephanie Plum, and she kicks butt for a living (well, she thinks it sounds good to put it that way. . . .).<br /><br />It begins as an innocent trip to the deli-mart, on a quest for nachos. But Stephanie Plum and her partner, Lula, are clearly in the wrong place at the wrong time. A robbery leads to an explosion, which leads to the destruction of yet another car. It would be just another day in the life of Stephanie Plum, except that she becomes the target of a gang---and of an even scarier, more dangerous force that comes to Trenton. With super bounty hunter Ranger acting more mysteriously than ever (and the tension with vice cop Joe Morelli getting hotter), she finds herself with a decision to make: how to protect herself and where to hide while on the hunt for a killer known as the Junkman. There's only one safe place, and it has Ranger's name all over it---if she can find it. And if the Junkman doesn't find her first.

Wise, Jane Goodall]","While the popular animal rights movement gains ever-increasing momentum, in the courts the dark ages prevail. The evolution of law that has brought fundamental rights to the most defenseless humans has yet to begin for other species. A human lost in a permanent vegetative state enjoys a large array of legal rights. But a chimpanzee—a creature who can communicate with language, count, understand the minds of others, feel a variety of emotions, live in a complex culture, and make and use tools—has no rights at all.Steven Wise, who has worked and communicated with the world's most prominent primatologists, demonstrates that, based on the latest scientific findings, the cognitive, emotional, and social capacities of at least chimps and bonobos entitle them to freedom from imprisonment and abuse. His path-breaking, witty, and impeccably researched book has everything needed to convince judges, scientists, lawyers, and the millions of others who simply care about animals of the injustice of denying them basic legal rights.",4.1,18.0,"{'Anger': 0.03853906117195658, 'Anticipation': 0.060419145681051036, 'Disgust': 0.03302654265523689, 'Fear': 0.04691711794846889, 'Joy': 0.04595789115811458, 'Sadness': 0.05589013817722627, 'Surprise': 0.0099565312416523, 'Trust': 0.15075645353214015, 'Objective': 0.5585371184341533}","{'Anger': 0.060353491771824204, 'Anticipation': 0.06702333939067845, 'Disgust': 0.036344070738962266, 'Fear': 0.07118564916804564, 'Joy': 0.0676730657949504, 'Sadness': 0.057663218379135656, 'Surprise': 0.025379937666873083, 'Trust': 0.14738637401906537, 'Objective': 0.46699085307046484}","{'Anger': 0.11296913011644112, 'Anticipation': 0.12860483242400625, 'Disgust': 0.06424336899785069, 'Fear': 0.12593589834431615, 'Joy': 0.11939346701622618, 'Sadness': 0.10871773069746572, 'Surprise': 0.019367486241999105, 'Trust': 0.3207680861616949}",en

4588,4588,9780140274059,841719,"Rainbow Six (John Clark, #2)",[Tom Clancy],"For many readers, Jack Ryan embodies the essence of the modern American hero. Morally centered, disciplined, humble yet powerful, Ryan (and his onscreen incarnations in <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1414078.Alec_Baldwin"" title=""Alec Baldwin"" rel=""nofollow"">Alec Baldwin</a> and <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1820344.Harrison_Ford"" title=""Harrison Ford"" rel=""nofollow"">Harrison Ford</a>) has made Tom Clancy one of the most popular writers in the world. But as Clancy has constructed the Ryan mythology, he has quietly established Ryan's shadow double, John Clark. Appearing in <i><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/382549.The_Cardinal_of_the_Kremlin"" title=""The Cardinal of the Kremlin"" rel=""nofollow"">The Cardinal of the Kremlin</a>, <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32669.Clear_and_Present_Danger"" title=""Clear and Present Danger"" rel=""nofollow"">Clear and Present Danger</a>,</i> and <i><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19668.Without_Remorse"" title=""Without Remorse"" rel=""nofollow"">Without Remorse</a>,</i> Clark has many of Jack Ryan's most appealing traits, but he is also a darker figure embodying the more paranoid sensibilities of the late '90s. As is made clear from the opening pages of <i>Rainbow Six</i>, ex-Navy SEAL Clark and his colleagues believe violent, deadly force to be the best deterrent for terrorism. Clark (a. k. a. Rainbow Six) has left the CIA to create an England-based organization code-named ""Rainbow. "" Its mission: deploy an elite squad of American operatives combined with handpicked British, French, and German agents to stop terrorism in its tracks. Rainbow's emergence could not be more timely: in quick succession, the force diffuses three attempted terrorist actions. But Clark becomes suspicious when Russian agents suddenly show interest in Rainbow's work. Rainbow Six appeals on all the levels that Clancy fans could hope for. The Rainbow operatives, from Navy SEALs to German mountain-leader school graduates, are rendered to inspire with their physical and mental prowess. The book is infatuated with the latest gadgets for scrambling, transmitting, and decoding secrets. And, in a carefully woven narrative that simultaneously traces the Rainbow team, a former KGB agent named Popov, the Australian Olympic security team, and a sinister group of American scientists, Clancy artfully reveals the mystery of ""Shiva"" at the center of the novel. How does Clark measure up against Jack Ryan? He may be the perfect hero for a world with hidden villains.",4.09,18.0,"{'Anger': 0.03739016954110275, 'Anticipation': 0.04781351603721579, 'Disgust': 0.02706807519659793, 'Fear': 0.052780496585552464, 'Joy': 0.05758997378694295, 'Sadness': 0.028429354123775133, 'Surprise': 0.02763621226951073, 'Trust': 0.08002857560723166, 'Objective': 0.6412636268520706}","{'Anger': 0.043614941480071945, 'Anticipation': 0.053233584443343855, 'Disgust': 0.03791152933816438, 'Fear': 0.051184735291817655, 'Joy': 0.06094935224044, 'Sadness': 0.03293798712300915, 'Surprise': 0.029439824831217584, 'Trust': 0.09640539061074474, 'Objective': 0.5943226546411907}","{'Anger': 0.09516875789186299, 'Anticipation': 0.1278965270115008, 'Disgust': 0.08272378763920962, 'Fear': 0.1299327698590556, 'Joy': 0.14055763477311245, 'Sadness': 0.10174388842754274, 'Surprise': 0.07151876414847509, 'Trust': 0.25045787024924077}",en

4683,4683,9783257700480,2271211,Tao-Te-King,[Lao Tzu],"<b>A lucid translation of the well-known Taoist classic by a leading scholar-now in a Shambhala Pocket Library edition.</b> <br />Written more than two thousand years ago, the <i>Tao Teh Ching</i>, or -The Classic of the Way and Its Virtue, - is one of the true classics of the world of spiritual literature. Traditionally attributed to the legendary -Old Master, - Lao Tzu, the <i>Tao Teh Ching</i> teaches that the qualities of the enlightened sage or ideal ruler are identical with those of the perfected individual. Today, Lao Tzu's words are as useful in mastering the arts of leadership in business and politics as they are in developing a sense of balance and harmony in everyday life. To follow the <i>Tao </i>or Way of all things and realize their true nature is to embody humility, spontaneity, and generosity. <br />John C. H. Wu has done a remarkable job of rendering this subtle text into English while retaining the freshness and depth of the original. A jurist and scholar, Dr. Wu was a recognized authority on Taoism and the translator of several Taoist and Zen texts and of Chinese poetry.<br />This book is part of the Shambhala Pocket Library series. The Shambhala Pocket Library is a collection of short, portable teachings from notable figures across religious traditions and classic texts. The covers in this series are rendered by Colorado artist Robert Spellman. The books in this collection distill the wisdom and heart of the work Shambhala Publications has published over 50 years into a compact format that is collectible, reader-friendly, and applicable to everyday life.",4.29,18.0,"{'Anger': 0.0023442573614433026, 'Anticipation': 0.020916161120174866, 'Disgust': 0.0019799470958136, 'Fear': 0.0, 'Joy': 0.08669000364310264, 'Sadness': 0.0, 'Surprise': 0.009717580346253148, 'Trust': 0.12597215402404446, 'Objective': 0.7523798964091679}","{'Anger': 0.002254654032479206, 'Anticipation': 0.020116693580329664, 'Disgust': 0.0019042686085128425, 'Fear': 0.0029706590292800346, 'Joy': 0.08954632704670791, 'Sadness': 0.0014015416958654521, 'Surprise': 0.012499619146278297, 'Trust': 0.14568416562566652, 'Objective': 0.7236220712348802}","{'Anger': 0.00815629219365683, 'Anticipation': 0.08288556391391802, 'Disgust': 0.006888760298696645, 'Fear': 0.010746466065966766, 'Joy': 0.3180953955526163, 'Sadness': 0.005070127579840731, 'Surprise': 0.04177344245129645, 'Trust': 0.5263839519440081}",en

4819,4819,9780671866396,356609,Warriors Don't Cry: A Searing Memoir of the Battle to Integrate Little Rock's Central High,[Melba Pattillo Beals],"The landmark 1954 Supreme Court ruling, Brown v. Board of Education, brought the promise of integration to Little Rock, Arkansas, but it was hard-won for the nine black teenagers chosen to integrate Central High School in 1957. They ran the gauntlet between a rampaging mob and the heavily armed Arkansas National Guard, dispatched by Governor Orval Faubus to subvert federal law and bar them from entering the school. President Dwight D. Eisenhower responded by sending in soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division, the elite ""Screaming Eagles"" - and transformed Melba Pattillo and her eight friends into reluctant warriors on the battlefield of civil rights. May 17, 1994, marks the fortieth anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education ruling, which was argued and won by Thurgood Marshall, whose passion and presence emboldened the Little Rock struggle. Melba Pattillo Beals commemorates the milestone decision in this first-person account of her ordeal at the center of the violent confrontation that helped shape the civil rights movement. Beals takes us from the lynch mob that greeted the terrified fifteen-year-old to a celebrity homecoming with her eight compatriots thirty years later, on October 23, 1987, hosted by Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton in the mansion that Faubus built. As they returned to tour the halls of the school, gathering from myriad professions and all corners of the country, they were greeted by the legacy of their courage - a bespectacled black teenager, the president of the student body at Central High. Beals chronicles her harrowing junior year at Central High, when she began each school day by polishing her saddle shoes and bracing herself for battle. Nothing, not eventhe 101st Airborne Division, could blunt the segregationists' brutal organized campaign of terrorism that included telephone threats, insults and assaults at school, brigades of attacking mothers, rogue police, restroom fireball attacks, acid-throwers, vigilante stalkers, economic",4.12,16.333333333333332,"{'Anger': 0.07500218045440671, 'Anticipation': 0.021804544066983563, 'Disgust': 0.02769722210108587, 'Fear': 0.09580916663032578, 'Joy': 0.024868082508394757, 'Sadness': 0.028765644760368067, 'Surprise': 0.017879726134926523, 'Trust': 0.0703905193842397, 'Objective': 0.6377829139592692}","{'Anger': 0.07493410957437588, 'Anticipation': 0.03699549854964595, 'Disgust': 0.02590245668054996, 'Fear': 0.09270540734812063, 'Joy': 0.03186700584729735, 'Sadness': 0.030475277708389623, 'Surprise': 0.019468900228895948, 'Trust': 0.09119642738798626, 'Objective': 0.5964549166747384}","{'Anger': 0.1876284448756079, 'Anticipation': 0.09263348693532122, 'Disgust': 0.0648574820336733, 'Fear': 0.2321262174340383, 'Joy': 0.07979219055156303, 'Sadness': 0.0725418363309123, 'Surprise': 0.0487484203673683, 'Trust': 0.22167192147151554}",en
4869,4869,9780060099244,1040539,The Heart of Islam: Enduring Values for Humanity,[Seyyed Hossein Nasr],"As the specter of religious extremism has become a fact of life today, the temptation is great to allow the evil actions and perspectives of a minority to represent an entire tradition. In the case of Islam, there has been much recent confusion in the Western world centered on distorted portrayals of its core values. Born of ignorance, such confusion feeds the very problem at hand.<br /><br /><em>In The Heart of Islam</em> one of the great intellectual figures in Islamic history offers a timely presentation of the core spiritual and social values of Islam: peace, compassion, social justice, and respect for the other. Seizing this unique moment in history to reflect on the essence of his tradition, Seyyed Hossein Nasr seeks to ""open a spiritual and intellectual space for mutual understanding."" Exploring Islamic values in scripture, traditional sources, and history, he also shows their clear counterparts in the Jewish and Christian traditions, revealing the common ground of the Abrahamic faiths.<br /><br />Nasr challenges members of the world's civilizations to stop demonizing others while identifying themselves with pure goodness and to turn instead to a deeper understanding of those shared values that can solve the acute problems facing humanity today. ""Muslims must ask themselves what went wrong within their own societies,"" he writes, ""but the West must also pose the same question about itself . . . whether we are Muslims, Jews, Christians, or even secularists, whether we live in the Islamic world or in the West, we are in need of meaning in our lives, of ethical norms to guide our actions, of a vision that would allow us to live at peace with each other and with the rest of God's creation."" Such help, he believes, lies at the heart of every religion and can lead the followers of the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) as well as other religious and spiritual traditions to a new future of mutual respect and common global purpose.<br /><br /><em>The Heart of Islam</em> is a landmark presentation of enduring value that offers hope to humanity, and a compelling portrait of the beauty and appeal of the faith of 1.2 billion people.",4.3,19.0,"{'Anger': 0.010682708959985417, 'Anticipation': 0.049141676541184336, 'Disgust': 0.010919697384012397, 'Fear': 0.025023546926746274, 'Joy': 0.08178531279433661, 'Sadness': 0.02329778506972929, 'Surprise': 0.0058882508431318935, 'Trust': 0.13090875945674965, 'Objective': 0.6623522620241242}","{'Anger': 0.015470804189915909, 'Anticipation': 0.05271637233218444, 'Disgust': 0.01955181821243727, 'Fear': 0.039109249924217764, 'Joy': 0.0848368155740926, 'Sadness': 0.028718662639916476, 'Surprise': 0.0064948187401062075, 'Trust': 0.14123002997608652, 'Objective': 0.6118714284110429}","{'Anger': 0.03825601360784376, 'Anticipation': 0.14480799781760995, 'Disgust': 0.045862284769805986, 'Fear': 0.08058796155142256, 'Joy': 0.23248872699263448, 'Sadness': 0.06629009740520242, 'Surprise': 0.018566362308840283, 'Trust': 0.37314055554664055}",en

5100,5100,9780192822406,197961,An Oxford Anthology of Shakespeare,[Stanley Wells],"This elegantly-crafted anthology presents over two hundred of the finest examples of Shakespeare's work, ranging from two-line aphorisms to sonnets and even complete scenes. Ideal for browsing, it allows readers to revisit favorite passages such as Hamlet's soliloquy or the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet, or to discover unfamiliar gems. Above all, it permits readers to savor Shakespeare's unequaled capacity to portray the peaks and valleys of human experience. <br /> The anthology reveals Shakespeare's extraordinary ability to capture in words the hearts, minds, and imaginations of kings and peasants, wise men and fools, warriors and page-boys, statesmen and common thieves, as well as quintessential expressions of admiration and vituperation, villainy and virtue, grief, joy, and despair.<br /> In creating this anthology, Stanley Wells--the General Editor of the Oxford Shakespeare--has selected those passages which he finds most attractive in their own right and which suffer least from being read out of context. He has also arranged the excerpts according to subject matter, under headings such as Friendship, Love, Hatred, Responsibility and Government, Time, Wisdom and Folly, and Death. For readers looking for a particular quotation, this edition--based on the text of the Complete Oxford Shakespeare--also contains a play-by-play index and glossary.",4.59,18.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.0660629148892488, 'Anticipation': 0.06380454866893262, 'Disgust': 0.08517918653192509, 'Fear': 0.13160115883842416, 'Joy': 0.21167050664963385, 'Sadness': 0.13728129205921935, 'Surprise': 0.047380067066633204, 'Trust': 0.25702032529598284}",en

She has no freedom, no vote, no control over her own life, no value but as a bearer of sons. Hidden behind her black floor-length veil, she is a prisoner, jailed by her father, her husband, her sons, and her country. Sultana is a member of the Saudi royal family, closely related to the king. For the sake of her daughters, she has decided to take the risk of speaking out about the life of women in her country, regardless of their rank. She must hide her identity for fear that the religious leaders in her country would call for her death to punish her honesty. Only a woman in her position could possibly hope to escape from being revealed and punished, despite her cloak of anonymity. She tells of her own life, from her turbulent childhood to her arranged marriage - a happy one until her husband decided to displace her by taking a second wife - and of the lives of her sisters, her friends, and her servants. Although they share affection, confidences and an easy camaraderie within the confines of the women's quarters, they also share a history of appalling oppressions, everyday occurrences that in any other culture would be seen as shocking human rights violations: thirteen-year-old girls forced to marry men five times their age, young women killed by drowning, stoning, or isolation in the ""woman's room, "" a padded, windowless cell where women are confined with neither light nor conversation until death claims them.

Martin soon gets addicted to those delights, jacks in his degree and goes down deeper into a life less ordinary – scuba-diving, bed-hopping and bar-keeping his way into corners and out again.<br /><br /><br />Out on the high seas, on board the laden ‘Anne’, ship’s surgeon Martin is looking for the fresh start a life on the ocean wave can afford a man with a problematic past. As his captain steers his precious cargo – but not his crew – to safety through a raging, swelling storm and onward to the riches of the uncharted African coast, Martin comes to realize that down deeper lie secrets, desires and freedoms of uncanny power.<br /><br /><br />The laws seem different out on the ocean, criss-crossing the Mediterranean or hugging Africa’s shore, couriering yachts or cocaine, trafficking in spices or more human contraband. Living outside the dry land’s dry laws is liberating, but, as Martin discovers, the lawgivers and the lawkeepers always turn up, looking for their justice.<br /><br /><br />Christopher Wallace, the prize-winning author of The Pied Piper’s Poison and The Resurrection Club, tells an exhilarating pair of stories that reflect off each other like the sun off the sea to illuminate just how a man – with all his principles and compromises, desires and doubts – can find honour and more in piracy.",4.0,13.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.07622474701348045, 'Anticipation': 0.1566689803821284, 'Disgust': 0.06433346728528112, 'Fear': 0.0774303145435283, 'Joy': 0.24237387206371241, 'Sadness': 0.0661600847550506, 'Surprise': 0.07964052168194938, 'Trust': 0.2371680122748694}",en

THE REAL HISTORY? <br /><br />It’s a story of how regular people banded together and, armed with little more than their brains and good aim, defeated a mighty foe.<br /><br />Not long ago the streets of New York City were smelly, smoggy, sooty, and loud. There were so many trucks making deliveries that it might take an hour for a car to travel a few blocks. People blamed the truck owners and the truck owners blamed the little wooden pushcarts that traveled the city selling everything from flowers to hot dogs. Behind closed doors the truck owners declared war on the pushcart peddlers. Carts were smashed from Chinatown to Chelsea. The peddlers didn’t have money or the mayor on their side, but that didn’t stop them from fighting back. They used pea shooters to blow tacks into the tires of trucks, they outwitted the police, and they marched right up to the grilles of those giant trucks and dared them to drive down their streets. Today, thanks to the ingenuity of the pushcart peddlers, the streets belong to the people—and to the pushcarts.<br /><br />The Pushcart War was first published more than fifty years ago. It has inspired generations of children and been adapted for television, radio, and the stage around the world.

A convicted murderer, Sirius Black, has broken out of Azkaban prison, and it seems he's after Harry. Now Hogwarts is being patrolled by the dementors, the Azkaban guards who are hunting Sirius. But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer. But if Harry has learned anything from his education in wizardry, it is that things are often not what they seem.

At seven, she knows she is an intruder in her parents' party, in her parents' life. But she can't resist the magic. Later, she waits for the click, click, click of her mother's high heels, the angry words, and the pain that will follow. Gabriella already knows to hide her bruises, certain she is to blame for her mother's rage--and her father's failure to protect her. Her world is a confusing blend of terror, betrayal, and pain. Her parents' aristocratic world is no safeguard against the abuse that knows no boundaries, respects no person, no economic lines. Gabriella knows that, try as she might, there is no safe place for her to hide.<br /><br />Even as a child, her only escape is through the stories she writes. Only writing can dull the pain of her lonely world. And when her parents' marriage collapses, Gabriella is given her first reprieve, as her father disappears, and then her mother abandons her to a convent. There, Gabriella's battered body and soul begin to mend. Amid the quiet safety and hushed rituals of the nuns, Gabriella grows into womanhood in a safe, peaceful world. Then a young priest comes into her life.<br /><br />Father Joe Connors never questioned his vocation until Gabriella entered the confessional and shared her soul. Confession leads to friendship. And friendship grows dangerously into love. Like Gabriella, Joe is haunted by the pain of his childhood, consumed by guilt over a family tragedy, for which he blames himself. With Gabriella, Joe takes the first steps toward healing. But their relationship leads to tragedy as Joe must choose between the priesthood and Gabriella, and life in the real world where he fears he does not belong, and cannot cope.<br /><br />Exiled and disgraced, and nearly destroyed, Gabriella struggles to survive on her own in New York. There she seeks healing and escape through her writing again, this time as an adult, and her life as a writer begins. But just when she thinks she is beyond hurt, Gabriella is once again betrayed by someone she trusts. Brought to the edge of despair, physically attacked beyond recognition and belief, haunted by abuse in her present and her past, she nonetheless manages to find hope again, and the courage to face the past. On a pilgrimage destined to bring her face-to-face with those who sought to destroy her in her early life, she finds forgiveness, freedom from guilt, and healing from abuse. When Gabriella faces what was done to her, and why, she herself is free at last.<br /><br />With profound insight, Danielle Steel has created a vivid portrait of an abused child's broken world, and the courage necessary to face it and free herself from the past. A work of daring and compassion, a tale of healing that will shock and touch and move you to your very soul, it exposes the terror of child abuse, and opens the doors on a subject that affects us all. <i>The Long Road Home</i> is more than riveting fiction. It is an inspiration to us all.

Bradley, Ron Powers]","In this unforgettable chronicle of perhaps the most famous moment in American military history, James Bradley has captured the glory, the triumph, the heartbreak, and the legacy of the six men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima. Here is the true story behind the immortal photograph that has come to symbolize the courage and indomitable will of America.<br /><br />In February 1945, American Marines plunged into the surf at Iwo Jima—and into history. Through a hail of machine-gun and mortar fire that left the beaches strewn with comrades, they battled to the island's highest peak. And after climbing through a landscape of hell itself, they raised a flag.<br /><br />Now the son of one of the flagraisers has written a powerful account of six very different young men who came together in a moment that will live forever.<br /><br />To his family, John Bradley never spoke of the photograph or the war. But after his death at age seventy, his family discovered closed boxes of letters and photos. In <b>Flags of Our Fathers</b>, James Bradley draws on those documents to retrace the lives of his father and the men of Easy Company. Following these men's paths to Iwo Jima, James Bradley has written a classic story of the heroic battle for the Pacific's most crucial island—an island riddled with Japanese tunnels and 22,000 fanatic defenders who would fight to the last man.<br /><br />But perhaps the most interesting part of the story is what happened after the victory. The men in the photo—three were killed during the battle—were proclaimed heroes and flown home, to become reluctant symbols. For two of them, the adulation was shattering. Only James Bradley's father truly survived, displaying no copy of the famous photograph in his home, telling his son only: ""The real heroes of Iwo Jima were the guys who didn't come back.""<br /><br />Few books ever have captured the complexity and furor of war and its aftermath as well as <b>Flags of Our Fathers</b>. A penetrating, epic look at a generation at war, this is history told with keen insight, enormous honesty, and the passion of a son paying homage to his father. It is the story of the difference between truth and myth, the meaning of being a hero, and the essence of the human experience of war.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",4.19,18.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.1067189423732055, 'Anticipation': 0.13987735927993403, 'Disgust': 0.035572980791068506, 'Fear': 0.1692704909214789, 'Joy': 0.16686788032369496, 'Sadness': 0.07389521749004889, 'Surprise': 0.04641461169748622, 'Trust': 0.261382517123083}",en

It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood."" So begins the luminous memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland.

A correspondent for the <i>Toronto Star,</i> Hemingway arrived in Paris in 1921, three years after the trauma of the Great War and at the beginning of the transformation of Europe's cultural landscape: Braque and Picasso were experimenting with cubist form; James Joyce, long living in self-imposed exile from his native Dublin, had just completed <i>Ulysses;</i> Gertrude Stein held court at 27 Rue de Fleurus, and deemed young Ernest a member of <i>une gneration perdue;</i> and T.S.

9679,9679,9780553275568,922195,The Right Stuff,[Tom Wolfe],"Tom Wolfe began <i>The Right Stuff</i> at a time when it was unfashionable to contemplate American heroism. Nixon had left the White House in disgrace, the nation was reeling from the catastrophe of Vietnam, and in 1979--the year the book appeared--Americans were being held hostage by Iranian militants. Yet it was exactly the anachronistic courage of his subjects that captivated Wolfe. In his foreword, he notes that as late as 1970, almost one in four career Navy pilots died in accidents. ""<i>The Right Stuff</i>,"" he explains, ""became a story of why men were willing--willing?--delighted!--to take on such odds in this, an era literary people had long since characterized as the age of the anti-hero."" <p> Wolfe's roots in New Journalism were intertwined with the nonfiction novel that Truman Capote had pioneered with <i>In Cold Blood</i>. As Capote did, Wolfe tells his story from a limited omniscient perspective, dropping into the lives of his ""characters"" as each in turn becomes a major player in the space program. After an opening chapter on the terror of being a test pilot's wife, the story cuts back to the late 1940s, when Americans were first attempting to break the sound barrier. Test pilots, we discover, are people who live fast lives with dangerous machines, not all of them airborne. Chuck Yeager was certainly among the fastest, and his determination to push through Mach 1--a feat that some had predicted would cause the destruction of any aircraft--makes him the book's guiding spirit.</p><p> Yet soon the focus shifts to the seven initial astronauts. Wolfe traces Alan Shepard's suborbital flight and Gus Grissom's embarrassing panic on the high seas (making the controversial claim that Grissom flooded his Liberty capsule by blowing the escape hatch too soon). The author also produces an admiring portrait of John Glenn's apple-pie heroism and selfless dedication. By the time Wolfe concludes with a return to Yeager and his late-career exploits, the narrative's epic proportions and literary merits are secure. Certainly <i>The Right Stuff</i> is the best, the funniest, and the most vivid book ever written about America's manned space program. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>",4.23,19.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.062108620588751676, 'Anticipation': 0.19434365306958507, 'Disgust': 0.02709662316380874, 'Fear': 0.14038450283841516, 'Joy': 0.12189091121905539, 'Sadness': 0.1012611927196114, 'Surprise': 0.10652835488968222, 'Trust': 0.2463861415110903}",en

As Peter Theroux in the New York Times Book Review points out, ""Her wonderfully witty voice and her penchant for history lessons of the Nile both ancient and modern keep [her] high adventure moving for even the highest brows."" In her previous outing, The Last Camel Died at Noon, Amelia Peabody and her dashing husband, Emerson, discovered a fabulous lost oasis in the Nubian desert. Now, in the seventh mystery in the series, the Emerson-Peabodys are traveling up the Nile once again to encounter their most deadly adversary, the Master Criminal, who is back at his sinister best. Amelia Peabody was unabashedly proud of her newest translation, a fragment of the ancient fairytale ""The Doomed Prince."" Later, she would wonder why no sense of foreboding struck her as she retold the story of the king's favorite son who had been warned that he would die from the snake, the crocodile, or the dog. Little did she realize, as she and her beloved husband sailed blissfully toward the pyramids of ancient Egypt, that those very beasts (and a cat as well) would be part of a deadly plot. The expedition began so happily....Leaving their delightful, but catastrophically precocious, son, Ramses, back in England, Amelia hoped this romantic trip might rejuvenate her thirteen-year-old marriage and bring back the thrills that she feared were fading. She and her dear Emerson were returning to the remote desert site where they had first fallen in love, Amarna, the holy city of Akhenaton and his beautiful queen, Nefertiti. But their return would threaten not only their marriage, but their very lives with perils as chilling as a mummy'scurse. An old enemy was determined to learn Amelia and Emerson's most closely guarded secret: the location of a legendary long-lost oasis and a race of people bedecked in gold. So cunning was his scheme that Amelia might overlook - until it was too late - the truth about the myst",4.21,17.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.09520094963540784, 'Anticipation': 0.14579164546944776, 'Disgust': 0.06843027528121644, 'Fear': 0.16337120569781244, 'Joy': 0.20992595104855571, 'Sadness': 0.10661918489627494, 'Surprise': 0.04716522525577977, 'Trust': 0.16349556271550506}",en

9973,9973,9780452264717,1276568,Kaffir Boy: The True Story of a Black Youth's Coming of Age in Apartheid South Africa,[Mark Mathabane],"I am always asked to explain what it felt like to grow up black under South Africa's system of legalized racism known as apartheid, and how I escaped from it and ended up in America. This book is the most thorough answer I have heretofore given. The last thing I ever dreamed of when I was daily battling for survival and for an identity other than that of inferiority and fourth-class citizen, which apartheid foisted on me, was that someday I would attend an American college, edit its newspaper, graduate with honors, practise journalism and write a book.<br /><br />How could I have dreamed of all this when I was born of illiterate parents who could not afford to pay my way through school, let alone pay the rent for our shack and put enough food on the table; when black people in Alexandra lived under constant police terror and the threat of deportation to impoverished tribal reserves; when at ten I contemplated suicide because I found the burden of living in a ghetto, poverty-stricken and without hope, too heavy to shoulder; when in 1976 I got deeply involved in the Soweto protests, in which hundreds of black students were killed by the police, and thousands fled the country to escape imprisonment and torture?<br /><br />In ""Kaffir Boy"" I have re-created, as best as I can remember, all these experiences. I have sought to paint a portrait of my childhood and youth in Alexandra, a black ghetto of Johannesburg, where I was born and lived for eighteen years, with the hope that the rest of the world will finally understand why apartheid cannot be reformed: it has to be abolished.<br /><br />Much has been written and spoken about the politics of apartheid: the forced removals of black communities from theirancestral lands, the Influx Control and Pass laws that mandate where blacks can live, work, raise families, be buried; the migrant labour system that forces black men to live away from their families eleven months out of a year; the breaking up of black families in the ghettos as the authorities seek to create a so-called white South Africa; the brutal suppression of the black majority as it agitates for equal rights. But what does it all mean in human terms?<br /><br />When I was growing up in Alexandra it meant hate, bitterness, hunger, pain, terror, violence, fear, dashed hopes and dreams. Today it still means the same for millions of black children who are trapped in the ghettos of South Africa, in a lingering nightmare of a racial system that in many respects resembles Nazism. In the ghettos black children fight for survival from the moment they are born. They take to hating and fearing the police, soldiers and authorities as a baby takes to its mother's breast.<br /><br />In my childhood these enforcers of white prerogatives and whims represented a sinister force capable of crushing me at will; of making my parents flee in the dead of night to escape arrest under the Pass laws; of marching them naked out of bed because they did not have the permit allowing them to live as husband and wife under the same roof. They turned my father -- by repeatedly arresting him and denying him the right to earn a living in a way that gave him dignity -- into such a bitter man that, as he fiercely but in vain resisted the emasculation, he hurt those he loved the most.<br /><br />The movies, with their lurid descriptions of white violence, reinforced this image of white terror and power. Often the products of abjectpoverty and broken homes, many black children, for whom education is inferior and not compulsory, have been derailed by movies into the dead-end life of crime and violence. It is no wonder that black ghettos have one of the highest murder rates in the world, and South African prisons are among the most packed. It was purely by accident that I did not end up a ""tsotsi"" (thug, mugger, gangster). It was no coincidence that, until the age of ten, I refused to set foot in the white world.<br /><br />The turning point came when one day in my eleventh year I accompanied my grandmother to her gardening job and met a white family that did not fit the stereotypes I had grown up with. Most blacks, exposed daily to virulent racism and dehumanized and embittered by it, do not believe that such whites exist. From this family I started receiving ""illegal books"" like ""Treasure Island"" and ""David Copperfield, "" which revealed a different reality and marked the beginning of my revolt against Bantu education's attempts to proscribe the limits of my aspirations and determine my place in South African life.<br /><br />At thirteen I stumbled across tennis, a sport so ""white"" most blacks thought I was mad for thinking I could excel in it; others mistook me for an Uncle Tom. Through tennis I learned the important lesson that South Africa's 4.5 million whites are not all racists. As I grew older, and got to understand them more -- their fears, longings, hop",4.15,17.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.12071720138157767, 'Anticipation': 0.1324366007277295, 'Disgust': 0.06959605474594113, 'Fear': 0.1921371973181137, 'Joy': 0.13625533329639283, 'Sadness': 0.14052658798322892, 'Surprise': 0.03874143440276315, 'Trust': 0.169589590144253}",en

Doctorow]","<b><i>The Call of the Wild</i>—Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time</b><br /><br />To this day Jack London is the most widely read American writer in the world,"" E. L. Doctorow wrote in The New York Times Book Review. Generally considered to be London's greatest achievement, The Call of the Wild brought him international acclaim when it was published in 1903. His story of the dog Buck, who learns to survive in the bleak Yukon wilderness, is viewed by many as his symbolic autobiography. ""No other popular writer of his time did any better writing than you will find in The Call of the Wild,"" said H. L. Mencken. ""Here, indeed, are all the elements of sound fiction.""<br />        White Fang (1906), which London conceived as a ""complete antithesis and companion piece to The Call of the Wild,"" is the tale of an abused wolf-dog tamed by exposure to civilization. Also included in this volume is ""To Build a Fire,"" a marvelously desolate short story set in the Klondike, but containing all the elements of a classic Greek tragedy.<br />        ""The quintessential Jack London is in the on-rushing compulsive-ness of his northern stories,"" noted James Dickey. ""Few men have more convincingly examined the connection between the creative powers of the individual writer and the unconscious drive to breed and to survive, found in the natural world. . . . London is in and committed to his creations to a degree very nearly unparalleled in the composition of fiction.""",4.2,19.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.09766259862297212, 'Anticipation': 0.1542507609113206, 'Disgust': 0.06899914305132827, 'Fear': 0.10144499276026124, 'Joy': 0.13078809727844926, 'Sadness': 0.11066457846990338, 'Surprise': 0.0805827250967761, 'Trust': 0.2556071038089891}",en

Doyle transmogrified the legend: generations ago, a hound of hell tore out the throat of devilish Hugo Baskerville on the moonlit moor. Poor, accursed Baskerville Hall now has another mysterious death: that of Sir Charles Baskerville. Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore, history-obsessed Dr. Frankland, butterfly-chasing Stapleton, or Selden, the Notting Hill murderer at large? Someone's been signaling with candles from the mansion's windows. Nor can supernatural forces be ruled out. Can Dr. Watson--left alone by Sherlock Holmes to sleuth in fear for much of the novel--save the next Baskerville, Sir Henry, from the hound's fangs?<p> Many Holmes fans prefer Doyle's complete short stories, but their clockwork logic doesn't match the author's boast about this novel: it's ""a real Creeper!"" What distinguishes this particular <i>Hound</i> is its fulfillment of Doyle's great debt to Edgar Allan Poe--it's full of ancient woe, low moans, a Grimpen Mire that sucks ponies to Dostoyevskian deaths, and locals digging up Neolithic skulls without next-of-kins' consent. ""The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul,"" Watson realizes. ""Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay ... while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet ... it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths.""

Now, in this breathless new novel, Garwood has written her most electrifying thriller to date.<br /><br /><b>KILLJOY<br /><br /></b>Avery Delaney has always tried to put the past far behind her. Abandoned by her rapacious, conniving mother when she was only three days old, Avery was raised by her grandmother and beloved aunt Carolyn. Then, when she was eleven, she witnessed her grandmother’s violent death, before Avery herself was shot and left for dead. Miraculously she survived. The man responsible is serving time in a Florida prison.

At first she is resistant, but then figures it will be a welcome respite from the cutthroat advertising business, not to mention a networking extravaganza.

Under false pretenses, she is taken to an isolated retreat by a handsome stranger with a dazzling smile, suave demeanor, and the darkest of motives. His name is Monk, a hired assassin.

It tells the tale of a hidden home high in the hills. It is discovered one day by a little girl called Lucie, who is in search of her missing pocket handkerchiefs. She knocks on the tiny door, and meets Mrs Tiggy-winkle who does all the washing and ironing for the neighbouring animals. Lucie spends a lovely day helping her, and it's only right at the end of the day that she realises Mrs Tiggy-winkle is a hedgehog!<br /><br />Beatrix Potter is regarded as one of the world's best-loved children's authors of all time. From her first book, <i>The Tale of Peter Rabbit</i>, published by Frederick Warne in 1902, she went on to create a series of stories based around animal characters including Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, Benjamin Bunny, Jemima Puddle-duck, Mr. Jeremy Fisher and Tom Kitten.<br /><br />Her humorous, lively tales and beautiful illustrations have become a natural part of childhood. With revenue from the sales of her books, Beatrix Potter bought a farm - Hill Top - in the English Lake District, where she later became a farmer and prize-winning sheep breeder. She launched the now vast merchandise programme by patenting the very first Peter Rabbit doll in 1903. The product range continues to grow today with licences around the world including baby clothing and bedding, nursery decor products and collectables. Upon her death, Beatrix Potter left 14 farms and over 4000 acres of Lake District farmland to the National Trust so that the place that she loved would remain undeveloped and protected for future generations to enjoy.<br /><br />Today Beatrix Potter's original 23 tales are still published by Frederick Warne, alongside a wide range of other formats including baby books, activity books and gift and sound books.<br /><br /><i>The Tale of Mrs Tiggy-winkle</i> is number six in Beatrix Potter's series of 23 little books.

12637,12637,9780140620580,861453,Hamlet,[William Shakespeare],"Undoubtedly the most famous of all of Shakespeare's plays, <i>Hamlet</i> remains one of the most enduring but also enigmatic pieces of western literature. The story of Hamlet, the young Prince of Denmark, his tortured relationship with his mother, and his quest to avenge his father's murder at the hand of his brother Claudius has fascinated writers and audiences ever since it was written around 1600. <p> For many years interest focused on both Hamlet's inability to avenge his father's death, claiming that ""the native hue of resolution / Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought"", and, according to none other than Freud, his oedipal fixation with his mother. However, more recently critics have turned their attention to <i>Hamlet's</i> bold theatrical self-reflexivity (most famously reflected in the performance of ""The Mousetrap""), its fascination with issues of theology and Renaissance humanism, and its dense, complex poetic language. What is so remarkable about the play is the way in which it tends to uncannily reflect the concerns of different epochs. As a result, Hamlet has been at different moments defined as a romantic rebel, an angst-ridden existentialist, a paralysed intellectual and an ambivalent New Man. Whatever subsequent generations make of <i>Hamlet</i>, they are unlikely to exhaust the possibilities of this most extraordinary play. --<i>Jerry Brotton</i></p>",4.02,16.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.10432757964492802, 'Anticipation': 0.17155842120581188, 'Disgust': 0.07352183938925828, 'Fear': 0.1388273221841628, 'Joy': 0.08498444041462376, 'Sadness': 0.11706629055007052, 'Surprise': 0.10246938455683166, 'Trust': 0.20724472205431302}",en

12983,12983,9780609609767,1860346,Love in the Driest Season,[Neely Tucker],"Foreign correspondent Neely Tucker and his wife, Vita, arrived in Zimbabwe in 1997. After witnessing firsthand the devastating consequences of AIDS on the population, especially the children, the couple started volunteering at an orphanage that was desperately underfunded and short-staffed. One afternoon, a critically ill infant was brought to the orphanage from a village outside the city. She’d been left to die in a field on the day she was born, abandoned in the tall brown grass that covers the highlands of Zimbabwe in the dry season. After a near-death hospital stay, and under strict doctor’s orders, the ailing child was entrusted to the care of Tucker and Vita. Within weeks Chipo, the girl-child whose name means gift, would come to mean everything to them. <br /><br />Still an active correspondent, Tucker crisscrossed the continent, filing stories about the uprisings in the Congo, the civil war in Sierra Leone, and the postgenocidal conflict in Rwanda. He witnessed heartbreaking scenes of devastation and violence, steeling him further to take a personal role in helping anywhere he could. At home in Harare, Vita was nursing Chipo back to health. Soon she and Tucker decided to alter their lives forever—they would adopt Chipo. That decision challenged an unspoken social norm—that foreigners should never adopt Zimbabwean children. <br /><br />Raised in rural Mississippi in the sixties and seventies, Tucker was familiar with the mores associated with and dictated by race. His wife, a savvy black woman whose father escaped the Jim Crow South for a new life in the industrial North, would not be deterred in her resolve to welcome Chipo into their loving family. <br /><br />As if their situation wasn’t tenuous enough, Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe was stirring up national fervor against foreigners, especially journalists, abroad and at home. At its peak, his antagonizing branded all foreign journalists personae non grata.

Bruce Cameron],"Fathers may suspect it's not easy for their daughters to become women, but those same daughters have no idea how hard it is for fathers to stand by and watch. According to W. Bruce Cameron, ""Having a child mutate into a teenager is a bit like being an airline passenger who must suddenly take over for a stricken pilot and land the plane. And in this case, the passengers are all yelling, 'I hate you! I hate you!' and slamming the door to the cockpit."" Cameron has two daughters, so he is doubly aware that raising teenage girls is well, impossible. He's been through braces (the most expensive metal on earth), kissing (do they have to use their lips?), teen ""logic"" (""I asked if I could go out with Lindsey and you said no, so I went out with Courtney""), and, of course, dating, which leads to the 8 Simple Rules.

She said he had lived across the ocean near what he called the ""<i>Kamby Bolongo</i>"" and had been out in the forest one day chopping wood to make a drum when he was set upon by four men, beaten, chained and dragged aboard a slave ship bound for Colonial America.<br /><br />Still vividly remembering the stories after he grew up and became a writer, Haley began to search for documentation that might authenticate the narrative. It took ten years and a half a million miles of travel across three continents to find it, but finally, in an astonishing feat of genealogical detective work, he discovered not only the name of ""the African""—Kunta Kinte—but the precise location of Juffure, the very village in The Gambia, West Africa, from which he was abducted in 1767 at the age of sixteen and taken on the <i>Lord Ligonier</i> to Maryland and sold to a Virginia planter.<br /><br />Haley has talked in Juffure with his own African sixth cousins. On September 29, 1967, he stood on the dock in Annapolis where his great-great-great-great-grandfather was taken ashore on September 29, 1767.

Wolfe plunges us deep into the earth's rocky crust, where life may have begun-a world devoid of oxygen and light but safe from asteroid bombardment. Primitive microbes found there are turning our notion of the evolutionary tree of life on its head: amazingly, they represent perhaps a full third of earth's genetic diversity.

In <em>Napalm &amp; Silly Putty</em>, Carlin doesn't steer clear of the tough issues, preferring instead to look life boldly in the eye to pose the questions few dare to ask: How can it be a spy satellite if they announce on TV that it's a spy satellite?

Guys don't seem to be called ""Lefty"" anymore. Most people don't know what they're doing, and a lot of them are really good at it.<br />Carlin also waxes wickedly philosophical on all sorts of subjects, including: KIDS--They're not all cute. In fact, if you look at them closely, some of them are rather unpleasant looking. And a lot of them don't smell too good either.

Doyler might once have made a scholar like Jim, might once have had prospects like Jim, but his folks sent him to work, and now, schoolboy no more, he hauls the parish midden cart, with socialism and revolution and willful blasphemy stuffed under his cap. And yet the future is rosy, Jim's father is sure. His elder son is away fighting the Hun for God and the British Army, and he has such plans for Jim and their corner shop empire. But Mr. Mack cannot see that the landscape is changing, nor does he realize the depth of Jim's burgeoning friendship with Doyler. Out at the Forty Foot, that great jut of rock where gentlemen bathe in the scandalous nude, the two boys meet day after day. There they make a pact: Doyler will teach Jim to swim, and in a year, Easter 1916, they will swim the bay to the distant beacon of Muglins Rock and claim that island for themselves.<br /><br />Ten years in the writing, ""At Swim, Two Boys"" has already caused a sensation in England and Ireland, earning lavish praise for its masterful portrayal of class, tradition, and the conflict that has haunted Ireland for centuries.

14293,14293,9783404124275,2077976,Maria Stuart. Der Roman Ihres Lebens,[Margaret George],"She became Queen of Scots when she was only six days old. Life among the warring factions in Scotland was dangerous for the infant Queen, however, and at age five Mary was sent to France to be raised alongside her betrothed, the Dauphin Francois. Surrounded by all the sensual comforts of the French court, Mary's youth was peaceful, charmed, and when she became Queen of France at the age of sixteen, she seemed to have all she could wish for. But by her eighteenth birthday, Mary was a widow who had lost one throne and had been named by the Pope for another. And her extraordinary adventure had only begun. Defying her powerful cousin Elizabeth I, Mary set sail in 1561 to take her place as the Catholic Queen of a newly Protestant Scotland. A virtual stranger in her volatile native land, Mary would be hailed as a saint, denounced as a whore, and ultimately accused of murdering her second husband, Lord Darnley, in order to marry her lover, the Earl of Bothwell. She was but twenty-five years old when she fled Scotland for the imagined sanctuary of Elizabeth's England, where she would be embroiled in intrigue until she was beheaded ""like a criminal"" in 1587. In her stunning first novel, The Autobiography of Henry VIII, Margaret George established herself as one of the finest historical novelists of our time. Now she brings us a new, mesmerizing blend of history and storytelling as she turns the astonishing facts of the life of Mary Queen of Scots into magnificent fiction that sweeps us from the glittering French court where Mary spent her youth, to the bloodstained Scotland where she reigned as Queen, to the cold English castles where she ended her days. Never before have we been offered such arich and moving portrayal of the Scots Queen, whose beauty inspired poetry, whose spirit brought forth both devotion and hatred, and whose birthright generated glorious dreams, hideous treachery, and murdered men at her feet.",4.06,16.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.09369231348812679, 'Anticipation': 0.15587758843695457, 'Disgust': 0.07505682317632137, 'Fear': 0.14772770082754638, 'Joy': 0.19670237213215627, 'Sadness': 0.0888450767897731, 'Surprise': 0.10516996722464304, 'Trust': 0.13692815792447857}",en

Doyle transmogrified the legend: generations ago, a hound of hell tore out the throat of devilish Hugo Baskerville on the moonlit moor. Poor, accursed Baskerville Hall now has another mysterious death: that of Sir Charles Baskerville. Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore, history-obsessed Dr. Frankland, butterfly-chasing Stapleton, or Selden, the Notting Hill murderer at large? Someone's been signaling with candles from the mansion's windows. Nor can supernatural forces be ruled out. Can Dr. Watson--left alone by Sherlock Holmes to sleuth in fear for much of the novel--save the next Baskerville, Sir Henry, from the hound's fangs?<p> Many Holmes fans prefer Doyle's complete short stories, but their clockwork logic doesn't match the author's boast about this novel: it's ""a real Creeper!"" What distinguishes this particular <i>Hound</i> is its fulfillment of Doyle's great debt to Edgar Allan Poe--it's full of ancient woe, low moans, a Grimpen Mire that sucks ponies to Dostoyevskian deaths, and locals digging up Neolithic skulls without next-of-kins' consent. ""The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul,"" Watson realizes. ""Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay ... while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet ... it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths.""

14395,14395,9781552781425,3764845,"Pianist:  The Extraordinary True Story Of One Man's Survival In Warsaw, 1939 1945",[Władysław Szpilman],"The last live broadcast on Polish Radio, on September 23, 1939, was Chopin's Nocturne in C# Minor, played by a young pianist named Wladyslaw Szpilman, until his playing was interrupted by German shelling. It was the same piece and the same pianist, when broadcasting resumed six years later. <i>The Pianist</i> is Szpilman's account of the years inbetween, of the death and cruelty inflicted on the Jews of Warsaw and on Warsaw itself, related with a dispassionate restraint borne of shock. Szpilman, now 88, has not looked at his description since he wrote it in 1946 (the same time as Primo Levi's <i>If This Is A Man?</i>; it is too personally painful. The rest of us have no such excuse. <p> Szpilman's family were deported to Treblinka, where they were exterminated; he survived only because a music-loving policeman recognised him. This was only the first in a series of fatefully lucky escapes that littered his life as he hid among the rubble and corpses of the Warsaw Ghetto, growing thinner and hungrier, yet condemned to live. Ironically it was a German officer, Wilm Hosenfeld, who saved Szpilman's life by bringing food and an eiderdown to the derelict ruin where he discovered him. Hosenfeld died seven years later in a Stalingrad labour camp, but portions of his diary, reprinted here, tell of his outraged incomprehension of the madness and evil he witnessed, thereby establishing an effective counterpoint to ground the nightmarish vision of the pianist in a desperate reality. Szpilman originally published his account in Poland in 1946, but it was almost immediately withdrawn by Stalin's Polish minions as it unashamedly described collaborations by Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Poles and Jews with the Nazis. In 1997 it was published in Germany after Szpilman's son found it on his father's bookcase. This admirably robust translation by Anthea Bell is the first in the English language. There were 3,500,000 Jews in Poland before the Nazi occupation; after it there were 240,000. Wladyslaw Szpilman's extraordinary account of his own miraculous survival offers a voice across the years for the faceless millions who lost their lives. --<i>David Vincent</i></p>",4.24,16.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.10434496379196839, 'Anticipation': 0.10274616759146053, 'Disgust': 0.08067651023543057, 'Fear': 0.1672936455688266, 'Joy': 0.1424966299884009, 'Sadness': 0.16351609768331296, 'Surprise': 0.05815229317533465, 'Trust': 0.18077369196526535}",en

His agenda in this tome, which was first published in 1978 but didn't become a bestseller until 1983, is to reconcile the psychoanalytic tradition with the conflicting cultural currents roiling the 70s. In the spirit of Me-Decade individualism and libertinism, he celebrates self-actualization as life's highest purpose and flirts with the notions of open marriage and therapeutic sex between patient and analyst. But because he is attuned to the nascent conservative backlash against the therapeutic worldview, Peck also cites Gospel passages, recruits psychotherapy to the cause of traditional religion (he even convinces a patient to sign up for divinity school) and insists that problems must be overcome through suffering, discipline and hard work (with a therapist.) Often departing from the cerebral and rationalistic bent of Freudian discourse for a mystical, Jungian tone more compatible with New Age spirituality, Peck writes of psychotherapy as an exercise in ""love"" and ""spiritual growth,"" asserts that ""our unconscious is God"" and affirms his belief in miracles, reincarnation and telepathy. Peck's synthesis of such clashing elements (he even throws in a little thermodynamics) is held together by a warm and lucid discussion of psychiatric principles and moving accounts of his own patients' struggles and breakthroughs.

15120,15120,9780452273054,907781,The Bluest Eye,[Toni Morrison],"Originally published in 1970, The Bluest Eye is Toni Morrison's first novel. In an afterword written more than two decades later, the author expressed her dissatisfaction with the book's language and structure: ""It required a sophistication unavailable to me."" Perhaps we can chalk up this verdict to modesty, or to the Nobel laureate's impossibly high standards of quality control. In any case, her debut is nothing if not sophisticated, in terms of both narrative ingenuity and rhetorical sweep. It also shows the young author drawing a bead on the subjects that would dominate much of her career: racial hatred, historical memory, and the dazzling or degrading power of language itself.<br /><br />Set in Lorain, Ohio, in 1941, The Bluest Eye is something of an ensemble piece. The point of view is passed like a baton from one character to the next, with Morrison's own voice functioning as a kind of gold standard throughout. The focus, though, is on an 11-year-old black girl named Pecola Breedlove, whose entire family has been given a cosmetic cross to bear:<br /><br /> You looked at them and wondered why they were so ugly; you looked closely and could not find the source. Then you realized that it came from conviction, their conviction. It was as though some mysterious all-knowing master had given each one a cloak of ugliness to wear, and they had each accepted it without question.... And they took the ugliness in their hands, threw it as a mantle over them, and went about the world with it. <br /><br />There are far uglier things in the world than, well, ugliness, and poor Pecola is subjected to most of them. She's spat upon, ridiculed, and ultimately raped and impregnated by her own father. No wonder she yearns to be the very opposite of what she is--yearns, in other words, to be a white child, possessed of the blondest hair and the bluest eye.<br /><br />This vein of self-hatred is exactly what keeps Morrison's novel from devolving into a cut-and-dried scenario of victimization. She may in fact pin too much of the blame on the beauty myth: ""Along with the idea of romantic love, she was introduced to another--physical beauty. Probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought. Both originated in envy, thrived in insecurity, and ended in disillusion."" Yet the destructive power of these ideas is essentially colorblind, which gives The Bluest Eye the sort of universal reach that Morrison's imitators can only dream of. And that, combined with the novel's modulated pathos and musical, fine-grained language, makes for not merely a sophisticated debut but a permanent one. --James Marcus",4.06,16.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.10614723490738133, 'Anticipation': 0.1344531642160163, 'Disgust': 0.10139693189191835, 'Fear': 0.12751135542795577, 'Joy': 0.16040842811493775, 'Sadness': 0.1278174316531789, 'Surprise': 0.03882270840730175, 'Trust': 0.20344274538130977}",en

Brown, William Reichard]","For many, it is often difficult to imagine gay gathering places in the decades before the Stonewall riots of the 1960s, and nearly impossible to think of such communities outside the nation's largest cities. Yet such places did exist, and their histories tell amazing stories of survival and the struggle for acceptance and self-respect. When Ricardo J. Brown died in 1999, he left a compelling memoir of his youth and experiences as a young gay man in St. Paul. After being discharged from the navy for revealing his sexual orientation to a commanding officer in 1945, Brown returned to his hometown with a new self-awareness and a desire to find a group of people like himself. He discovered such a place in Kirmser's.<br /><p><br />A small neighborhood bar owned by a German immigrant couple in St. Paul's downtown, Kirmser's served working-class customers during daylight hours, but became an unofficial home to the gay men and lesbians who gathered there nightly in the years following World War II. The Evening Crowd at Kirmser's introduces us to often humorous but frequently tragic stories of those who would become the author's friends: Flaming Youth, a homely, sardonic man who carried the nickname from his younger years ironically into middle age; Bud York, the ""All-American Boy,"" who seduced all with his wholesome good looks and confidence; Dickie Grant, a likable, gentle boy who is arrested for writing bad checks and is murdered while in prison; and Dale, the author's best friend, who suddenly loses his job of six years after an anonymous note informed his employer that he is gay.<br /></p><p><br />A revealing look at the origins of gay culture in a mid-sized city and among working-class people, <i>The Evening Crowd at Kirmser's</i> is destined to become a rare and unique classic.</p>",4.03,18.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.07014096959575618, 'Anticipation': 0.11064721580955188, 'Disgust': 0.038541513171897766, 'Fear': 0.13281595363230025, 'Joy': 0.18309674672953816, 'Sadness': 0.0928663817803756, 'Surprise': 0.07957168819686625, 'Trust': 0.292319531083714}",en

Conn Iggulden is just such a writer, bringing to vivid life one of the most fascinating eras in human history. In a true masterpiece of historical fiction, Iggulden takes us on a breathtaking journey through ancient Rome, sweeping us into a realm of tyrants and slaves, of dark intrigues and seething passions. What emerges is both a grand romantic tale of coming-of-age in the Roman Empire and a vibrant portrait of the early years of a man who would become the most powerful ruler on earth: Julius Caesar.<br /><br />On the lush Italian peninsula, a new empire is taking shape. At its heart is the city of Rome, a place of glory and decadence, beauty and bloodshed. Against this vivid backdrop, two boys are growing to manhood, dreaming of battles, fame, and glory in service of the mightiest empire the world has ever known. One is the son of a senator, a boy of privilege and ambition to whom much has been given and from whom much is expected. The other is a bastard child, a boy of strength and cunning, whose love for his adoptive family–and his adoptive brother–will be the most powerful force in his life.<br /><br />As young Gaius and Marcus are trained in the art of combat–under the tutelage of one of Rome’s most fearsome gladiators–Rome itself is being rocked by the art of treachery and ambition, caught in a tug-of-war as two rival generals, Marius and Sulla, push the empire toward civil war. For Marcus, a bloody campaign in Greece will become a young soldier’s proving ground. For Gaius, the equally deadly infighting of the Roman Senate will be the battlefield where he hones his courage and skill. And for both, the love of an extraordinary slave girl will be an honor each will covet but only one will win.<br /><br />The two friends are forced to walk different paths, and by the time they meet again everything will have changed. Both will have known love, loss, and violence. And the land where they were once innocent will be thrust into the grip of bitter conflict–a conflict that will set Roman against Roman...and put their friendship to the ultimate test. <br /><br />Brilliantly interweaving history and adventure, Conn Iggulden conjures a stunning array of contrasts–from the bloody stench of a battlefield to the opulence of the greatest city in history, from the tenderness of a lover to the treachery of an assassin.

What’s most intriguing about the selections in this volume is that the authors do dare. What’s most attractive about them is that they resist answering that dare with reductions. They prefer the swoon of multiple possibilities over the relative comfort of conclusions. Various as they are, the works collected in The Sacred Place share a common reverence for the word itself, and perhaps best of all—they share a common understanding that no one of them comprehends fully what that means. They seem to desire instead a sense that the humble stuff surrounding us affords a likely enough habitation for the sacred, even now.",4.27,18.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.025309371307754496, 'Anticipation': 0.22100615633356135, 'Disgust': 0.009731981841925254, 'Fear': 0.0810272992973074, 'Joy': 0.11594428207201046, 'Sadness': 0.03728001989926, 'Surprise': 0.059759965176295005, 'Trust': 0.4499409240718862}",en

Written in short, carefully numbered paragraphs of extreme compression and brilliance, it immediately convinced many of its readers and captivated the imagination of all. Its chief influence, at first, was on the Logical Positivists of the 1920s and 30s, but many other philosophers were stimulated by its philosophy of language, finding attractive, if ultimately unsatisfactory, its view that propositions were pictures of reality. Perhaps most of all, Wittgenstein himself, after his return to philosophy in the late 1920s, was fascinated by its vision of an inexpressible, crystalline world of logical relationships. The posthumous publication of other writings has, therefore, only served to reawaken interest in the <em>Tractatus</em> and to illuminate its more neglected aspects.<br />David Pears and Brian McGuinness revised their translation in the light of Wittgenstein's own suggestions and comments in his correspondence with C.K.

16437,16437,9781594200106,628036,The Shadow of the Wind,"[Carlos Ruiz Zafón, Lucia Graves]","Barcelona, 1945—just after the war, a great world city lies in shadow, nursing its wounds, and a boy named Daniel awakes on his eleventh birthday to find that he can no longer remember his mother’s face. To console his only child, Daniel’s widowed father, an antiquarian book dealer, initiates him into the secret of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a library tended by Barcelona’s guild of rare-book dealers as a repository for books forgotten by the world, waiting for someone who will care about them again. Daniel’s father coaxes him to choose a volume from the spiraling labyrinth of shelves, one that, it is said, will have a special meaning for him. And Daniel so loves the novel he selects, The Shadow of the Wind by one Julian Carax, that he sets out to find the rest of Carax’s work. To his shock, he discovers that someone has been systematically destroying every copy of every book this author has written. In fact, he may have the last one in existence. Before Daniel knows it his seemingly innocent quest has opened a door into one of Barcelona’s darkest secrets, an epic story of murder, magic, madness and doomed love. And before long he realizes that if he doesn’t find out the truth about Julian Carax, he and those closest to him will suffer horribly.<br /><br />As with all astounding novels, The Shadow of the Wind sends the mind groping for comparisons —The Crimson Petal and the White? The novels of Arturo Pérez-Reverte? Of Victor Hugo? Love in the Time of Cholera?—but in the end, as with all astounding novels, no comparison can suffice. As one leading Spanish reviewer wrote, “The originality of Ruiz Zafón’s voice is bombproof and displays a diabolical talent. The Shadow of the Wind announces a phenomenon in Spanish literature.” An uncannily absorbing historical mystery, a heart-piercing romance, and a moving homage to the mystical power of books, The Shadow of the Wind is a triumph of the storyteller’s art.<br />(front flap)",4.27,16.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.09360123569330497, 'Anticipation': 0.1077180188392586, 'Disgust': 0.06463334346196697, 'Fear': 0.16827458725817884, 'Joy': 0.12924136533981567, 'Sadness': 0.16343816469158315, 'Surprise': 0.0753696951281272, 'Trust': 0.1977235895877646}",en

The feeling is as haunting and familiar as the smellof a junior high school locker room.<br /><br />It's the feeling of being undersized … or oversized … or klutzy … or less than beautiful. Of being a nerd … or a geek … or just, somehow, different.<br /><br />It's knowing you are vulnerable-and someone is ready and willing to take full advantage of your weakness by making your life miserable.<br /><br />It's the fraternity you never wanted to join-the fellowship of the wounded spirit.<br /><br />And bestselling novelist Frank Peretti is a member, too.<br /><br /><br />This book is the haunting true story of pain Frank Peretti never forgot but never, until recently, shared with the world. It's the story of growing up with a medical condition that left him disfigured. A series of surgeries and the slow miracle of answered prayer took care of the deformity, but not the underdeveloped frame or the excruciating reality of being different. And it was for these petty ""crimes"" that Peretti was prosecuted every day at school-especially in gym class, but also in the halls, on the school grounds, even in his own neighborhood. No wonder he found himself relating to movie monsters who were hated but also feared-and who eventually exacted a bloody revenge on their tormentors!<br /><br /><br />In Peretti's case, deliverance eventually came-through time, through prayer, through a teacher's caring intervention, and his own willingness to seek help. But he has never forgotten what life was like at the bottom of the junior high food<br />chain. And from the reservoir of those agonizing memories he sends a compelling message to victims, to bullies, and to authorities who have the power to intervene-that it's never OK for the strong to abuse the weak. And that we allow such abuse at the expense of our souls … and our very civilization.<br /><br />Especially in the wake of the massacre at Columbine High School-perpetuated by two troubled but also tormented outsiders--this message takes on haunting resonance. Frank Peretti believes we cannot afford to overlook the continuing reality of wounded spirits, not only in our schools, but in our homes, churches, and workplaces. His approach is both tender and tough as he issues a ringing call for a change in attitude.<br /><br />It's a call for all of us to stop thinking of abuse as ""normal,"" even among kids.<br /><br />It's a call for the strong to stand up and protect the weak, not prey upon them.<br /><br />It's a call for those in authority to pay attention to the violence being done to the vulnerable in the midst of our everyday lives and to take action to help.<br /><br /><br />Most of all, it's a call for bullies and victims alike (many of us are both) to seek the healing and forgiveness offered in Jesus Christ. For that healing is really the heart of this book-the only reality that can break the natural cycle of victimization and abuse.<br /><br />Only in Christ, Peretti reminds, is there hope for the wounded spirits-but that hope is<br />powerful enough to change everything.",4.07,17.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.10988252569750365, 'Anticipation': 0.11226138032305431, 'Disgust': 0.055411160058737155, 'Fear': 0.19281204111600583, 'Joy': 0.13798825256975034, 'Sadness': 0.1498531571218796, 'Surprise': 0.04059471365638766, 'Trust': 0.20119676945668138}",en

17151,17151,9781853261589,136538,The Little Prince,"[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Irene Testot-Ferry]","Antoine de Saint-Exupéry first published <i>The Little Prince</i> in 1943, only a year before his Lockheed P-38 vanished over the Mediterranean during a reconnaissance mission. More than a half century later, this fable of love and loneliness has lost none of its power. The narrator is a downed pilot in the Sahara Desert, frantically trying to repair his wrecked plane. His efforts are interrupted one day by the apparition of a little, well, prince, who asks him to draw a sheep. ""In the face of an overpowering mystery, you don't dare disobey,"" the narrator recalls. ""Absurd as it seemed, a thousand miles from all inhabited regions and in danger of death, I took a scrap of paper and a pen out of my pocket."" And so begins their dialogue, which stretches the narrator's imagination in all sorts of surprising, childlike directions.<p> The Little Prince describes his journey from planet to planet, each tiny world populated by a single adult. It's a wonderfully inventive sequence, which evokes not only the great fairy tales but also such monuments of postmodern whimsy as Italo Calvino's <i>Invisible Cities</i>. And despite his tone of gentle bemusement, Saint-Exupéry pulls off some fine satiric touches, too. There's the king, for example, who commands the Little Prince to function as a one-man (or one-boy) judiciary: </p><blockquote>I have good reason to believe that there is an old rat living somewhere on my planet. I hear him at night. You could judge that old rat. From time to time you will condemn him to death. That way his life will depend on your justice. But you'll pardon him each time for economy's sake. There's only one rat. </blockquote> The author pokes similar fun at a businessman, a geographer, and a lamplighter, all of whom signify some futile aspect of adult existence. Yet his tale is ultimately a tender one--a heartfelt exposition of sadness and solitude, which never turns into <i>Peter Pan</i>-style treacle. Such delicacy of tone can present real headaches for a translator, and in her 1943 translation, Katherine Woods sometimes wandered off the mark, giving the text a slightly wooden or didactic accent. Happily, Richard Howard (who did a fine nip-and-tuck job on Stendhal's <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i> in 1999) has streamlined and simplified to wonderful effect. The result is a new and improved version of an indestructible classic, which also restores the original artwork to full color. ""Trying to be witty,"" we're told at one point, ""leads to lying, more or less."" But Saint-Exupéry's drawings offer a handy rebuttal: they're fresh, funny, and like the book itself, rigorously truthful. <i>--James Marcus</i>",4.31,18.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.07254901960784313, 'Anticipation': 0.15710645840257004, 'Disgust': 0.0626453971419076, 'Fear': 0.11456740888445774, 'Joy': 0.15322920128503376, 'Sadness': 0.11456740888445778, 'Surprise': 0.09510357815442562, 'Trust': 0.23023152763930432}",en

Readers will come away convinced of the enormous debt that we, the living, owe to the study of the remains of the dead.

Yet many fear that scientific discoveries about innate patterns of thinking and feeling may be used to justify inequality, to subvert social change, and to dissolve personal responsibility. <br /><br /> In <i>The Blank Slate</i>, Steven Pinker explores the idea of human nature and its moral, emotional, and political colorings. He shows how many intellectuals have denied the existence of human nature and instead have embraced three dogmas: The Blank Slate (the mind has no innate traits), The Noble Savage (people are born good and corrupted by society), and The Ghost in the Machine (each of us has a soul that makes choices free from biology). Each dogma carries a moral burden, so their defenders have engaged in desperate tactics to discredit the scientists who are now challenging them. <br /><br /> Pinker provides calm in the stormy debate by disentangling the political and moral issues from the scientific ones. He shows that equality, compassion, responsibility, and purpose have nothing to fear from discoveries about an innately organized psyche. Pinker shows that the new sciences of mind, brain, genes, and evolution, far from being dangerous, are complementing observations about the human condition made by millennia of artists and philosophers.

19247,19247,9780553381351,586472,The Right Stuff,[Tom Wolfe],"Tom Wolfe began <i>The Right Stuff</i> at a time when it was unfashionable to contemplate American heroism. Nixon had left the White House in disgrace, the nation was reeling from the catastrophe of Vietnam, and in 1979--the year the book appeared--Americans were being held hostage by Iranian militants. Yet it was exactly the anachronistic courage of his subjects that captivated Wolfe. In his foreword, he notes that as late as 1970, almost one in four career Navy pilots died in accidents. ""<i>The Right Stuff</i>,"" he explains, ""became a story of why men were willing--willing?--delighted!--to take on such odds in this, an era literary people had long since characterized as the age of the anti-hero."" <p> Wolfe's roots in New Journalism were intertwined with the nonfiction novel that Truman Capote had pioneered with <i>In Cold Blood</i>. As Capote did, Wolfe tells his story from a limited omniscient perspective, dropping into the lives of his ""characters"" as each in turn becomes a major player in the space program. After an opening chapter on the terror of being a test pilot's wife, the story cuts back to the late 1940s, when Americans were first attempting to break the sound barrier. Test pilots, we discover, are people who live fast lives with dangerous machines, not all of them airborne. Chuck Yeager was certainly among the fastest, and his determination to push through Mach 1--a feat that some had predicted would cause the destruction of any aircraft--makes him the book's guiding spirit.</p><p> Yet soon the focus shifts to the seven initial astronauts. Wolfe traces Alan Shepard's suborbital flight and Gus Grissom's embarrassing panic on the high seas (making the controversial claim that Grissom flooded his Liberty capsule by blowing the escape hatch too soon). The author also produces an admiring portrait of John Glenn's apple-pie heroism and selfless dedication. By the time Wolfe concludes with a return to Yeager and his late-career exploits, the narrative's epic proportions and literary merits are secure. Certainly <i>The Right Stuff</i> is the best, the funniest, and the most vivid book ever written about America's manned space program. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>",4.23,19.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.062108620588751676, 'Anticipation': 0.19434365306958507, 'Disgust': 0.02709662316380874, 'Fear': 0.14038450283841516, 'Joy': 0.12189091121905539, 'Sadness': 0.1012611927196114, 'Surprise': 0.10652835488968222, 'Trust': 0.2463861415110903}",en

Plotkin],"For thousands of years, healers have used plants to cure illness. Aspirin, the world's most widely used drug, is based on compounds originally extracted from the bark of a willow tree, and more than a quarter of medicines found on pharmacy shelves contain plant compounds. Now Western medicine, faced with health crises such as AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer, has begun to look to the healing plants used by indigenous peoples to develop powerful new medicines. Nowhere is the search more promising than in the Amazon, the world's largest tropical forest, home to a quarter of all botanical species on this planet—as well as hundreds of Indian tribes whose medicinal plants have never been studied by Western scientists. In <i>Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice</i>, ethnobotanist Mark J. Plotkin recounts his travels and studies with some of the most powerful Amazonian shamans, who taught him the plant lore their tribes have spent thousands of years gleaning from the rain forest.For more than a decade, Dr. Plotkin has raced against time to harvest and record new plants before the rain forests' fragile ecosystems succumb to overdevelopment—and before the Indians abandon their own culture and learning for the seductive appeal of Western material culture. <i>Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice</i> relates nine of the author's quests, taking the reader along on a wild odyssey as he participates in healing rituals; discovers the secret of curare, the lethal arrow poison that kills in minutes; tries the hallucinogenic snuff epena that enables the Indians to speak with their spirit world; and earns the respect and fellowship of the mysterious shamans as he proves that he shares both their endurance and their reverence for the rain forest.

In this masterful new novel, the killer may very well be the one you sympathize with the most... <br /><br />THE FIRST RULE IS NEVER BLAME THE VICTIM.<br /><br />They survived what no woman should ever have to endure. Now these three women have the means, the opportunity, and the perfect motive. Are they trying to get away with murder--or is someone trying to make sure that this time they don't get away at all? The Survivors Club... that's what Jillian Hayes, Carol Rosen, and Meg Pesaturo call it. They won't consider themselves victims. They are survivors. They faced the blazing headlines and helped lead the investigation that caught the man who changed their lives forever. <br /><br />And now that Eddie Como, the College Hill rapist, has been murdered, shot down outside a packed courthouse moments before his trial was about to begin, all three women are openly ecstatic that he's dead. They are also the prime suspects in his murder. Detective Sergeant Roan Griffin knows all too well what can drive even the best people to cross the line. But he has never seen a case quite like this one. No one doubts that the murder of Eddie Como was a professional job, especially when the gunman is killed only blocks away from the shooting.<br /><br />But questions taunt Griffin: Who ordered the deaths of Eddie Como and his killer? Could three ordinary women have been driven to do the unthinkable? Had someone in the Survivors Club become a killer? Griffin seeks the truth--and finds himself confronted with the leader of the Survivors Club. Jillian Hayes is beautiful, successful, cool as ice, and she harbors a pain that mirrors Griffin's own. Did the horror of what happened to her push her over the thin and desperate line that separates survival and revenge? And if it did, could he blame her--or anyone in the Survivors Club? Then another woman is brutally attacked.<br /><br />Suddenly, with the city on the ragged edge of panic, gripped in a media and political firestorm of controversy, cover-up, and conspiracy, the hunt is on for a ruthless and cunning killer. For Griffin, this may well be the case that shatters his career. For Jillian, the harrowing nightmare is beginning all over again. Someone is out there. Someone who wants to finish what was started. Someone who wants to make sure that no one survives the Survivors Club.",4.06,16.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.18494980605877714, 'Anticipation': 0.10499454124246647, 'Disgust': 0.08726911230838874, 'Fear': 0.22269067928246183, 'Joy': 0.05654917763595858, 'Sadness': 0.14377390980179833, 'Surprise': 0.11008938160709374, 'Trust': 0.08968339206305533}",en

Tolkien's three-volume epic, The Lord of the Rings - is set in the imaginary world of Middle-earth, a place of high and heroic adventure populated by many strange creatures - most notably hobbits, a peace-loving ""little-people"" with furry feet. Hobbits are cheerful and shy, enjoy large meals and long naps, and almost never lock their doors at night. But dark forces from the enemy land of Mordor threaten these lovable beings, along with the other inhabitants of Middle-earth - dwarves, elves, and even men.<br /><br />A the center of the saga is Frodo Baggins and the magical ring he inherited from his older cousin Bilbo (hero of Tolkien's earlier novel The Hobbit), a ring that has the power to corrupt even the strongest soul with a lust for power. From the wise wizard Gandalf, Frodo learns that he must abandon his comfortable hobbit hole in the Shire and with a band of brave companions, set off on a perilous journey to save the ring from enemy hands. They are pursued along the way by Orcs and the terrifying Black Riders commanded by Sauron the Dark Lord of Mordor; and they are hunted by the treacherous Gollum, who once owned the ring. But Middle-earth dwellers of all sorts also come to the company's aid, as their quest takes them to Rivendell, Moira, and the Elvish land of Lorien. Yet the most dangerous part of their journey is still to come - a desperate trip into the shadowy depths of Mordor to destroy the ring once and for all.

21142,21142,9780449911518,1202712,The Secret History,[Donna Tartt],"Storytelling in the grand manner, The Secret History is a debut remarkable for its hypnotic erudition and acute psychological suspense, and for the richness of its emotions, ideas, and language. These are the confessions, years afterward, of a young man who found at a small Vermont college the life of privilege and intellect he'd long coveted - and rarely has the glorious experience of youth infatuated with knowledge and with itself been so achingly realized. Then, amazed, Richard Papen is drawn into the ultimate inner circle: five students, worldly and self-assured, selected by a charismatic classics professor to participate in the search for truth and beauty. Together they study the mysteries of ancient Greek culture and spend long weekends at an old country house, reading, boating, basking in an Indian summer that stretches late into autumn. Mesmerized by his new comrades, Richard is unaware of the crime which they have committed in his dreamy, unwitting presence.

Within his dramatic story are themes that capture the intellect and the emotions: crime and punishment, the relentless persecution of Valjean by Inspector Javert, the desperation of the prostitute Fantine, the amorality of the rogue Thénardier, and the universal desire to escape the prisons of our own minds. Les Misérables gave Victor Hugo a canvas upon which he portrayed his criticism of the French political and judicial systems, but the portrait that resulted is larger than life, epic in scope—an extravagant spectacle that dazzles the senses even as it touches the heart.",4.18,17.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.11986387172206449, 'Anticipation': 0.1253131785535327, 'Disgust': 0.09625020878570237, 'Fear': 0.2004760314013696, 'Joy': 0.1428302989811258, 'Sadness': 0.11788040754969101, 'Surprise': 0.040462669116418916, 'Trust': 0.1569233338900952}",en
