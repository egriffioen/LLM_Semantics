llama3.2:1b,0,The Wounded Spirit,"Based on the emotion vectors provided, I would recommend the book ""The Wounded Spirit"" to teenagers in their late teens and early twenties. The normalized emotion vector suggests a high level of anticipation for the book's message, as well as a strong sense of disgust and sadness. These emotions are often associated with a desire to grow up and become more empathetic towards others who may be different from themselves.
