Hans Schwartz is Jewish, the son of a Stuttgart doctor who asserts that the rise of the Nazis is ""a temporary illness, something like measles which will pass off as soon as the economic situation improves."" The Holocaust would be unthinkable for these characters, but of course it looms over the story: Hans's friend, the young Count Konradin von Hohenfels, has a mother who keeps a portrait of Hitler on her dresser. The two boys share their most private thoughts and trips to the countryside of southwest Germany, discuss poetry and the past and present of their country, and argue the existence of a benevolent God.<br /><br />The eventual disintegration of this cherished relationship foreshadows the fate of Europe's Jews-- but Uhlman doesn't end his story with neat polarities. Years later, exiled in America, Hans comes upon a revelation about von Hohenfels which provides a stunning denouement and leaves the reader recalling Uhlman's haunting, lyrical descriptions of the vineyards, opera houses, and dark forests of Württemberg.",4.0,17.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.0736502253620177, 'Anticipation': 0.1731931080778697, 'Disgust': 0.06319726368954383, 'Fear': 0.16353930249656362, 'Joy': 0.15230316785474537, 'Sadness': 0.12001726177156921, 'Surprise': 0.04818911229741393, 'Trust': 0.20591055845027656}",en,1382,fiction

This is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.<br /><br />""When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood."" <br /><br />So begins the Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages.

2676,2676,9780425051818,7683125,Theory/practice Hell,[Eugen Kogon],"By the spring of 1945, the Second World War was drawing to a close in Europe. Allied troops were sweeping through Nazi Germany and discovering the atrocities of SS concentration camps. The first to be reached intact was Buchenwald, in central Germany. American soldiers struggled to make sense of the shocking scenes they witnessed inside. They asked a small group of former inmates to draft a report on the camp. It was led by Eugen Kogon, a German political prisoner who had been an inmate since 1939. <i>The Theory and Practice of Hell</i> is his classic account of life inside.<br /><br />Unlike many other books by survivors who published immediately after the war, <i>The Theory and Practice of Hell</i> is more than a personal account. It is a horrific examination of life and death inside a Nazi concentration camp, a brutal world of a state within state, and a society without law. But Kogon maintains a dispassionate and critical perspective. He tries to understand how the camp works, to uncover its structure and social organization. He knew that the book would shock some readers and provide others with gruesome fascination. But he firmly believed that he had to show the camp in honest, unflinching detail.<br /><br />The result is a unique historical document—a complete picture of the society, morality, and politics that fueled the systematic torture of six million human beings. For many years, <i>The Theory and Practice of Hell</i> remained the seminal work on the concentration camps, particularly in Germany.

9973,9973,9780452264717,1276568,Kaffir Boy: The True Story of a Black Youth's Coming of Age in Apartheid South Africa,[Mark Mathabane],"I am always asked to explain what it felt like to grow up black under South Africa's system of legalized racism known as apartheid, and how I escaped from it and ended up in America. This book is the most thorough answer I have heretofore given. The last thing I ever dreamed of when I was daily battling for survival and for an identity other than that of inferiority and fourth-class citizen, which apartheid foisted on me, was that someday I would attend an American college, edit its newspaper, graduate with honors, practise journalism and write a book.<br /><br />How could I have dreamed of all this when I was born of illiterate parents who could not afford to pay my way through school, let alone pay the rent for our shack and put enough food on the table; when black people in Alexandra lived under constant police terror and the threat of deportation to impoverished tribal reserves; when at ten I contemplated suicide because I found the burden of living in a ghetto, poverty-stricken and without hope, too heavy to shoulder; when in 1976 I got deeply involved in the Soweto protests, in which hundreds of black students were killed by the police, and thousands fled the country to escape imprisonment and torture?<br /><br />In ""Kaffir Boy"" I have re-created, as best as I can remember, all these experiences. I have sought to paint a portrait of my childhood and youth in Alexandra, a black ghetto of Johannesburg, where I was born and lived for eighteen years, with the hope that the rest of the world will finally understand why apartheid cannot be reformed: it has to be abolished.<br /><br />Much has been written and spoken about the politics of apartheid: the forced removals of black communities from theirancestral lands, the Influx Control and Pass laws that mandate where blacks can live, work, raise families, be buried; the migrant labour system that forces black men to live away from their families eleven months out of a year; the breaking up of black families in the ghettos as the authorities seek to create a so-called white South Africa; the brutal suppression of the black majority as it agitates for equal rights. But what does it all mean in human terms?<br /><br />When I was growing up in Alexandra it meant hate, bitterness, hunger, pain, terror, violence, fear, dashed hopes and dreams. Today it still means the same for millions of black children who are trapped in the ghettos of South Africa, in a lingering nightmare of a racial system that in many respects resembles Nazism. In the ghettos black children fight for survival from the moment they are born. They take to hating and fearing the police, soldiers and authorities as a baby takes to its mother's breast.<br /><br />In my childhood these enforcers of white prerogatives and whims represented a sinister force capable of crushing me at will; of making my parents flee in the dead of night to escape arrest under the Pass laws; of marching them naked out of bed because they did not have the permit allowing them to live as husband and wife under the same roof. They turned my father -- by repeatedly arresting him and denying him the right to earn a living in a way that gave him dignity -- into such a bitter man that, as he fiercely but in vain resisted the emasculation, he hurt those he loved the most.<br /><br />The movies, with their lurid descriptions of white violence, reinforced this image of white terror and power. Often the products of abjectpoverty and broken homes, many black children, for whom education is inferior and not compulsory, have been derailed by movies into the dead-end life of crime and violence. It is no wonder that black ghettos have one of the highest murder rates in the world, and South African prisons are among the most packed. It was purely by accident that I did not end up a ""tsotsi"" (thug, mugger, gangster). It was no coincidence that, until the age of ten, I refused to set foot in the white world.<br /><br />The turning point came when one day in my eleventh year I accompanied my grandmother to her gardening job and met a white family that did not fit the stereotypes I had grown up with. Most blacks, exposed daily to virulent racism and dehumanized and embittered by it, do not believe that such whites exist. From this family I started receiving ""illegal books"" like ""Treasure Island"" and ""David Copperfield, "" which revealed a different reality and marked the beginning of my revolt against Bantu education's attempts to proscribe the limits of my aspirations and determine my place in South African life.<br /><br />At thirteen I stumbled across tennis, a sport so ""white"" most blacks thought I was mad for thinking I could excel in it; others mistook me for an Uncle Tom. Through tennis I learned the important lesson that South Africa's 4.5 million whites are not all racists.

At seven, she knows she is an intruder in her parents' party, in her parents' life. But she can't resist the magic. Later, she waits for the click, click, click of her mother's high heels, the angry words, and the pain that will follow. Gabriella already knows to hide her bruises, certain she is to blame for her mother's rage--and her father's failure to protect her. Her world is a confusing blend of terror, betrayal, and pain. Her parents' aristocratic world is no safeguard against the abuse that knows no boundaries, respects no person, no economic lines. Gabriella knows that, try as she might, there is no safe place for her to hide.<br /><br />Even as a child, her only escape is through the stories she writes. Only writing can dull the pain of her lonely world. And when her parents' marriage collapses, Gabriella is given her first reprieve, as her father disappears, and then her mother abandons her to a convent. There, Gabriella's battered body and soul begin to mend. Amid the quiet safety and hushed rituals of the nuns, Gabriella grows into womanhood in a safe, peaceful world. Then a young priest comes into her life.<br /><br />Father Joe Connors never questioned his vocation until Gabriella entered the confessional and shared her soul. Confession leads to friendship. And friendship grows dangerously into love. Like Gabriella, Joe is haunted by the pain of his childhood, consumed by guilt over a family tragedy, for which he blames himself. With Gabriella, Joe takes the first steps toward healing. But their relationship leads to tragedy as Joe must choose between the priesthood and Gabriella, and life in the real world where he fears he does not belong, and cannot cope.<br /><br />Exiled and disgraced, and nearly destroyed, Gabriella struggles to survive on her own in New York. There she seeks healing and escape through her writing again, this time as an adult, and her life as a writer begins. But just when she thinks she is beyond hurt, Gabriella is once again betrayed by someone she trusts. Brought to the edge of despair, physically attacked beyond recognition and belief, haunted by abuse in her present and her past, she nonetheless manages to find hope again, and the courage to face the past. On a pilgrimage destined to bring her face-to-face with those who sought to destroy her in her early life, she finds forgiveness, freedom from guilt, and healing from abuse. When Gabriella faces what was done to her, and why, she herself is free at last.<br /><br />With profound insight, Danielle Steel has created a vivid portrait of an abused child's broken world, and the courage necessary to face it and free herself from the past. A work of daring and compassion, a tale of healing that will shock and touch and move you to your very soul, it exposes the terror of child abuse, and opens the doors on a subject that affects us all. <i>The Long Road Home</i> is more than riveting fiction.

No wonder he found himself relating to movie monsters who were hated but also feared-and who eventually exacted a bloody revenge on their tormentors!<br /><br /><br />In Peretti's case, deliverance eventually came-through time, through prayer, through a teacher's caring intervention, and his own willingness to seek help. But he has never forgotten what life was like at the bottom of the junior high food<br />chain. And from the reservoir of those agonizing memories he sends a compelling message to victims, to bullies, and to authorities who have the power to intervene-that it's never OK for the strong to abuse the weak. And that we allow such abuse at the expense of our souls … and our very civilization.<br /><br />Especially in the wake of the massacre at Columbine High School-perpetuated by two troubled but also tormented outsiders--this message takes on haunting resonance. Frank Peretti believes we cannot afford to overlook the continuing reality of wounded spirits, not only in our schools, but in our homes, churches, and workplaces. His approach is both tender and tough as he issues a ringing call for a change in attitude.<br /><br />It's a call for all of us to stop thinking of abuse as ""normal,"" even among kids.<br /><br />It's a call for the strong to stand up and protect the weak, not prey upon them.<br /><br />It's a call for those in authority to pay attention to the violence being done to the vulnerable in the midst of our everyday lives and to take action to help.<br /><br /><br />Most of all, it's a call for bullies and victims alike (many of us are both) to seek the healing and forgiveness offered in Jesus Christ. For that healing is really the heart of this book-the only reality that can break the natural cycle of victimization and abuse.<br /><br />Only in Christ, Peretti reminds, is there hope for the wounded spirits-but that hope is<br />powerful enough to change everything.",4.07,17.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.10988252569750365, 'Anticipation': 0.11226138032305431, 'Disgust': 0.055411160058737155, 'Fear': 0.19281204111600583, 'Joy': 0.13798825256975034, 'Sadness': 0.1498531571218796, 'Surprise': 0.04059471365638766, 'Trust': 0.20119676945668138}",en,3108,

It tells the tale of a hidden home high in the hills. It is discovered one day by a little girl called Lucie, who is in search of her missing pocket handkerchiefs. She knocks on the tiny door, and meets Mrs Tiggy-winkle who does all the washing and ironing for the neighbouring animals. Lucie spends a lovely day helping her, and it's only right at the end of the day that she realises Mrs Tiggy-winkle is a hedgehog!<br /><br />Beatrix Potter is regarded as one of the world's best-loved children's authors of all time. From her first book, <i>The Tale of Peter Rabbit</i>, published by Frederick Warne in 1902, she went on to create a series of stories based around animal characters including Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, Benjamin Bunny, Jemima Puddle-duck, Mr. Jeremy Fisher and Tom Kitten.<br /><br />Her humorous, lively tales and beautiful illustrations have become a natural part of childhood. With revenue from the sales of her books, Beatrix Potter bought a farm - Hill Top - in the English Lake District, where she later became a farmer and prize-winning sheep breeder. She launched the now vast merchandise programme by patenting the very first Peter Rabbit doll in 1903. The product range continues to grow today with licences around the world including baby clothing and bedding, nursery decor products and collectables. Upon her death, Beatrix Potter left 14 farms and over 4000 acres of Lake District farmland to the National Trust so that the place that she loved would remain undeveloped and protected for future generations to enjoy.<br /><br />Today Beatrix Potter's original 23 tales are still published by Frederick Warne, alongside a wide range of other formats including baby books, activity books and gift and sound books.<br /><br /><i>The Tale of Mrs Tiggy-winkle</i> is number six in Beatrix Potter's series of 23 little books.

Now, With Call Down the Stars, the saga begun in Song of the River and Cry of the Wind is complete, as Harrison vividly creates flesh-and-blood characters who fight for survival by day and are renewed at night by tales of the brave people who went before. It is the perfect conclusion to a sweeping epic that evokes a believable world sure to enchant all who enter it.Call Down the StarsThe Bear-god warriors came like a tsunami from the sea, their poorly made and misshapen outriggers sunk so deeply in the water that the Boat People only stood on the shore staring, sure that a wave would swamp the dugouts before the warriors could beach them. But the sea gods were asleep . . . .So begins the story of the little girl called Daughter as she and the grandfather, Water Gourd, flee their villagc and promised death at the hands of the Bear-god warriors. At the end of a perilous and daring journey across the North Pacific, they are guided by sea otters to the islands of the Whale Hunters.Daughter and Water Gourd believe they have found safety but they are soon ensnared in the plots and schemes of the medicine woman, Kos. She seeks revenge against her son, the warrior-statesman Chakliux, whom she blames for her status as slave-wife among the Whale Hunters.Unaware of Kos's plans, Chakhux, with the wisdom and help of his wife, Aqamdax, and brother, Sok, has brought the River People into prosperous times. Their lives revolve around caribou hunting inthe spring and fall, fishing in the summer, and storytelling during the winter. But years of peace are shattered by Kos's planned vengeance, and it is a forbidden love that makes that vengeance possible. Against the wishes of his people, Aqamdax's brother Ghaden takes the girl Daughter as his wife, giving Kos the opportunity to use the secrets of her poisons and plant medicines to devastate the lives of those she hates.The conclusion of Kos's story of hatred and revenge is told in a traditional manner, authentic to Native American storytelling that is a unique and stunning departure from modern literature that will both surprise and satisfy the reader.Call Down the Stars is a series of stories within a story Daughter's tale is presented as a duel between two storytellers, the quick-witted female Qumalix and the silvertongued man Yikaas.

Conn Iggulden is just such a writer, bringing to vivid life one of the most fascinating eras in human history. In a true masterpiece of historical fiction, Iggulden takes us on a breathtaking journey through ancient Rome, sweeping us into a realm of tyrants and slaves, of dark intrigues and seething passions. What emerges is both a grand romantic tale of coming-of-age in the Roman Empire and a vibrant portrait of the early years of a man who would become the most powerful ruler on earth: Julius Caesar.<br /><br />On the lush Italian peninsula, a new empire is taking shape. At its heart is the city of Rome, a place of glory and decadence, beauty and bloodshed. Against this vivid backdrop, two boys are growing to manhood, dreaming of battles, fame, and glory in service of the mightiest empire the world has ever known. One is the son of a senator, a boy of privilege and ambition to whom much has been given and from whom much is expected. The other is a bastard child, a boy of strength and cunning, whose love for his adoptive family–and his adoptive brother–will be the most powerful force in his life.<br /><br />As young Gaius and Marcus are trained in the art of combat–under the tutelage of one of Rome’s most fearsome gladiators–Rome itself is being rocked by the art of treachery and ambition, caught in a tug-of-war as two rival generals, Marius and Sulla, push the empire toward civil war. For Marcus, a bloody campaign in Greece will become a young soldier’s proving ground. For Gaius, the equally deadly infighting of the Roman Senate will be the battlefield where he hones his courage and skill. And for both, the love of an extraordinary slave girl will be an honor each will covet but only one will win.<br /><br />The two friends are forced to walk different paths, and by the time they meet again everything will have changed. Both will have known love, loss, and violence. And the land where they were once innocent will be thrust into the grip of bitter conflict–a conflict that will set Roman against Roman...and put their friendship to the ultimate test. <br /><br />Brilliantly interweaving history and adventure, Conn Iggulden conjures a stunning array of contrasts–from the bloody stench of a battlefield to the opulence of the greatest city in history, from the tenderness of a lover to the treachery of an assassin.

17151,17151,9781853261589,136538,The Little Prince,"[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Irene Testot-Ferry]","Antoine de Saint-Exupéry first published <i>The Little Prince</i> in 1943, only a year before his Lockheed P-38 vanished over the Mediterranean during a reconnaissance mission. More than a half century later, this fable of love and loneliness has lost none of its power. The narrator is a downed pilot in the Sahara Desert, frantically trying to repair his wrecked plane. His efforts are interrupted one day by the apparition of a little, well, prince, who asks him to draw a sheep. ""In the face of an overpowering mystery, you don't dare disobey,"" the narrator recalls. ""Absurd as it seemed, a thousand miles from all inhabited regions and in danger of death, I took a scrap of paper and a pen out of my pocket."" And so begins their dialogue, which stretches the narrator's imagination in all sorts of surprising, childlike directions.<p> The Little Prince describes his journey from planet to planet, each tiny world populated by a single adult. It's a wonderfully inventive sequence, which evokes not only the great fairy tales but also such monuments of postmodern whimsy as Italo Calvino's <i>Invisible Cities</i>. And despite his tone of gentle bemusement, Saint-Exupéry pulls off some fine satiric touches, too. There's the king, for example, who commands the Little Prince to function as a one-man (or one-boy) judiciary: </p><blockquote>I have good reason to believe that there is an old rat living somewhere on my planet. I hear him at night. You could judge that old rat. From time to time you will condemn him to death. That way his life will depend on your justice. But you'll pardon him each time for economy's sake. There's only one rat. </blockquote> The author pokes similar fun at a businessman, a geographer, and a lamplighter, all of whom signify some futile aspect of adult existence. Yet his tale is ultimately a tender one--a heartfelt exposition of sadness and solitude, which never turns into <i>Peter Pan</i>-style treacle. Such delicacy of tone can present real headaches for a translator, and in her 1943 translation, Katherine Woods sometimes wandered off the mark, giving the text a slightly wooden or didactic accent. Happily, Richard Howard (who did a fine nip-and-tuck job on Stendhal's <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i> in 1999) has streamlined and simplified to wonderful effect. The result is a new and improved version of an indestructible classic, which also restores the original artwork to full color. ""Trying to be witty,"" we're told at one point, ""leads to lying, more or less."" But Saint-Exupéry's drawings offer a handy rebuttal: they're fresh, funny, and like the book itself, rigorously truthful. <i>--James Marcus</i>",4.31,18.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.07254901960784313, 'Anticipation': 0.15710645840257004, 'Disgust': 0.0626453971419076, 'Fear': 0.11456740888445774, 'Joy': 0.15322920128503376, 'Sadness': 0.11456740888445778, 'Surprise': 0.09510357815442562, 'Trust': 0.23023152763930432}",en,2663,
15120,15120,9780452273054,907781,The Bluest Eye,[Toni Morrison],"Originally published in 1970, The Bluest Eye is Toni Morrison's first novel. In an afterword written more than two decades later, the author expressed her dissatisfaction with the book's language and structure: ""It required a sophistication unavailable to me."" Perhaps we can chalk up this verdict to modesty, or to the Nobel laureate's impossibly high standards of quality control. In any case, her debut is nothing if not sophisticated, in terms of both narrative ingenuity and rhetorical sweep. It also shows the young author drawing a bead on the subjects that would dominate much of her career: racial hatred, historical memory, and the dazzling or degrading power of language itself.<br /><br />Set in Lorain, Ohio, in 1941, The Bluest Eye is something of an ensemble piece. The point of view is passed like a baton from one character to the next, with Morrison's own voice functioning as a kind of gold standard throughout. The focus, though, is on an 11-year-old black girl named Pecola Breedlove, whose entire family has been given a cosmetic cross to bear:<br /><br /> You looked at them and wondered why they were so ugly; you looked closely and could not find the source. Then you realized that it came from conviction, their conviction. It was as though some mysterious all-knowing master had given each one a cloak of ugliness to wear, and they had each accepted it without question.... And they took the ugliness in their hands, threw it as a mantle over them, and went about the world with it. <br /><br />There are far uglier things in the world than, well, ugliness, and poor Pecola is subjected to most of them. She's spat upon, ridiculed, and ultimately raped and impregnated by her own father. No wonder she yearns to be the very opposite of what she is--yearns, in other words, to be a white child, possessed of the blondest hair and the bluest eye.<br /><br />This vein of self-hatred is exactly what keeps Morrison's novel from devolving into a cut-and-dried scenario of victimization. She may in fact pin too much of the blame on the beauty myth: ""Along with the idea of romantic love, she was introduced to another--physical beauty. Probably the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought. Both originated in envy, thrived in insecurity, and ended in disillusion."" Yet the destructive power of these ideas is essentially colorblind, which gives The Bluest Eye the sort of universal reach that Morrison's imitators can only dream of.

12983,12983,9780609609767,1860346,Love in the Driest Season,[Neely Tucker],"Foreign correspondent Neely Tucker and his wife, Vita, arrived in Zimbabwe in 1997. After witnessing firsthand the devastating consequences of AIDS on the population, especially the children, the couple started volunteering at an orphanage that was desperately underfunded and short-staffed. One afternoon, a critically ill infant was brought to the orphanage from a village outside the city. She’d been left to die in a field on the day she was born, abandoned in the tall brown grass that covers the highlands of Zimbabwe in the dry season. After a near-death hospital stay, and under strict doctor’s orders, the ailing child was entrusted to the care of Tucker and Vita. Within weeks Chipo, the girl-child whose name means gift, would come to mean everything to them. <br /><br />Still an active correspondent, Tucker crisscrossed the continent, filing stories about the uprisings in the Congo, the civil war in Sierra Leone, and the postgenocidal conflict in Rwanda. He witnessed heartbreaking scenes of devastation and violence, steeling him further to take a personal role in helping anywhere he could. At home in Harare, Vita was nursing Chipo back to health. Soon she and Tucker decided to alter their lives forever—they would adopt Chipo. That decision challenged an unspoken social norm—that foreigners should never adopt Zimbabwean children. <br /><br />Raised in rural Mississippi in the sixties and seventies, Tucker was familiar with the mores associated with and dictated by race. His wife, a savvy black woman whose father escaped the Jim Crow South for a new life in the industrial North, would not be deterred in her resolve to welcome Chipo into their loving family. <br /><br />As if their situation wasn’t tenuous enough, Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe was stirring up national fervor against foreigners, especially journalists, abroad and at home. At its peak, his antagonizing branded all foreign journalists personae non grata. For Tucker, the only full-time American correspondent in Zimbabwe, the declaration was a direct threat to his life and his wife’s safety, and an ultimatum to their decision to adopt the child who had already become their only daughter. <br /><br />Against a background of war, terrorism, disease, and unbearable uncertainty about the future, Chipo’s story emerges as an inspiring testament to the miracles that love—and dogged determination—can sometimes achieve. Gripping, heartbreaking, and triumphant, this family memoir will resonate throughout the ages.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",4.05,17.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.09460356709480962, 'Anticipation': 0.1324495730018087, 'Disgust': 0.04854957987041234, 'Fear': 0.18498294296769466, 'Joy': 0.15144126199143712, 'Sadness': 0.16137784188474485, 'Surprise': 0.03246559974357213, 'Trust': 0.19412963344552053}",en,2564,

Morally centered, disciplined, humble yet powerful, Ryan (and his onscreen incarnations in <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1414078.Alec_Baldwin"" title=""Alec Baldwin"" rel=""nofollow"">Alec Baldwin</a> and <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1820344.Harrison_Ford"" title=""Harrison Ford"" rel=""nofollow"">Harrison Ford</a>) has made Tom Clancy one of the most popular writers in the world. But as Clancy has constructed the Ryan mythology, he has quietly established Ryan's shadow double, John Clark. Appearing in <i><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/382549.The_Cardinal_of_the_Kremlin"" title=""The Cardinal of the Kremlin"" rel=""nofollow"">The Cardinal of the Kremlin</a>, <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32669.Clear_and_Present_Danger"" title=""Clear and Present Danger"" rel=""nofollow"">Clear and Present Danger</a>,</i> and <i><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19668.Without_Remorse"" title=""Without Remorse"" rel=""nofollow"">Without Remorse</a>,</i> Clark has many of Jack Ryan's most appealing traits, but he is also a darker figure embodying the more paranoid sensibilities of the late '90s. As is made clear from the opening pages of <i>Rainbow Six</i>, ex-Navy SEAL Clark and his colleagues believe violent, deadly force to be the best deterrent for terrorism. Clark (a. k. a. Rainbow Six) has left the CIA to create an England-based organization code-named ""Rainbow. "" Its mission: deploy an elite squad of American operatives combined with handpicked British, French, and German agents to stop terrorism in its tracks. Rainbow's emergence could not be more timely: in quick succession, the force diffuses three attempted terrorist actions. But Clark becomes suspicious when Russian agents suddenly show interest in Rainbow's work. Rainbow Six appeals on all the levels that Clancy fans could hope for. The Rainbow operatives, from Navy SEALs to German mountain-leader school graduates, are rendered to inspire with their physical and mental prowess. The book is infatuated with the latest gadgets for scrambling, transmitting, and decoding secrets. And, in a carefully woven narrative that simultaneously traces the Rainbow team, a former KGB agent named Popov, the Australian Olympic security team, and a sinister group of American scientists, Clancy artfully reveals the mystery of ""Shiva"" at the center of the novel. How does Clark measure up against Jack Ryan? He may be the perfect hero for a world with hidden villains.",4.09,18.0,"{'Anger': 0.03739016954110275, 'Anticipation': 0.04781351603721579, 'Disgust': 0.02706807519659793, 'Fear': 0.052780496585552464, 'Joy': 0.05758997378694295, 'Sadness': 0.028429354123775133, 'Surprise': 0.02763621226951073, 'Trust': 0.08002857560723166, 'Objective': 0.6412636268520706}","{'Anger': 0.043614941480071945, 'Anticipation': 0.053233584443343855, 'Disgust': 0.03791152933816438, 'Fear': 0.051184735291817655, 'Joy': 0.06094935224044, 'Sadness': 0.03293798712300915, 'Surprise': 0.029439824831217584, 'Trust': 0.09640539061074474, 'Objective': 0.5943226546411907}","{'Anger': 0.09516875789186299, 'Anticipation': 0.1278965270115008, 'Disgust': 0.08272378763920962, 'Fear': 0.1299327698590556, 'Joy': 0.14055763477311245, 'Sadness': 0.10174388842754274, 'Surprise': 0.07151876414847509, 'Trust': 0.25045787024924077}",en,2558,
20412,20412,9780553802511,424502,The Survivors Club,[Lisa Gardner],"One of today's most electrifying suspense novelists, ""New York Times"" bestselling author Lisa Gardner returns with a shattering thriller that dares to play on our deepest vulnerabilities. In this masterful new novel, the killer may very well be the one you sympathize with the most... <br /><br />THE FIRST RULE IS NEVER BLAME THE VICTIM.<br /><br />They survived what no woman should ever have to endure. Now these three women have the means, the opportunity, and the perfect motive. Are they trying to get away with murder--or is someone trying to make sure that this time they don't get away at all? The Survivors Club... that's what Jillian Hayes, Carol Rosen, and Meg Pesaturo call it. They won't consider themselves victims. They are survivors. They faced the blazing headlines and helped lead the investigation that caught the man who changed their lives forever. <br /><br />And now that Eddie Como, the College Hill rapist, has been murdered, shot down outside a packed courthouse moments before his trial was about to begin, all three women are openly ecstatic that he's dead. They are also the prime suspects in his murder. Detective Sergeant Roan Griffin knows all too well what can drive even the best people to cross the line. But he has never seen a case quite like this one. No one doubts that the murder of Eddie Como was a professional job, especially when the gunman is killed only blocks away from the shooting.<br /><br />But questions taunt Griffin: Who ordered the deaths of Eddie Como and his killer? Could three ordinary women have been driven to do the unthinkable? Had someone in the Survivors Club become a killer? Griffin seeks the truth--and finds himself confronted with the leader of the Survivors Club. Jillian Hayes is beautiful, successful, cool as ice, and she harbors a pain that mirrors Griffin's own. Did the horror of what happened to her push her over the thin and desperate line that separates survival and revenge? And if it did, could he blame her--or anyone in the Survivors Club? Then another woman is brutally attacked.<br /><br />Suddenly, with the city on the ragged edge of panic, gripped in a media and political firestorm of controversy, cover-up, and conspiracy, the hunt is on for a ruthless and cunning killer. For Griffin, this may well be the case that shatters his career. For Jillian, the harrowing nightmare is beginning all over again. Someone is out there. Someone who wants to finish what was started. Someone who wants to make sure that no one survives the Survivors Club.",4.06,16.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.18494980605877714, 'Anticipation': 0.10499454124246647, 'Disgust': 0.08726911230838874, 'Fear': 0.22269067928246183, 'Joy': 0.05654917763595858, 'Sadness': 0.14377390980179833, 'Surprise': 0.11008938160709374, 'Trust': 0.08968339206305533}",en,2536,
2512,2512,9780679452355,2018856,Still Me,[Christopher Reeve],"Christopher Reeve has beaten the odds before. He scored his first role in a Euripides play at 15, costarred with Katharine Hepburn at 22, and was one of two advanced-program students accepted at Juilliard, to which 2,000 drama students annually apply. (The other advanced student became his best friend, Robin Williams.) Reeve rode a sailplane to 32,000 feet over Pikes Peak, fell 90 feet from a parasail harness into four feet of water and walked away. He survived emergency appendectomy, malaria in Kenya, and the disastrous film <i>Changing Channels</i>, with Burt Reynolds. He flew vintage airplanes upside down. On his first solo transatlantic flight, a radar controller informed him he was about to run out of gas 200 miles west of Iceland. The radar controller had misread his screen, and Reeve landed safely.<p> Then, in 1995, his horse balked at a 3-foot-3-inch racecourse fence, made an abrupt ""dirty stop,"" Reeve's hands got tangled in the reins, he landed on his head and got a ""hangman's injury""--a broken neck. Ace paramedics got oxygen to him 60 seconds before brain damage set in, and a helicopter named Pegasus lofted him to a hospital.</p><p> Reeve was already important. His interpretation of <i>Superman</i> was classic, and his starring role in <i>The Bostonians</i> launched the Merchant/Ivory school of filmmaking. But it was not until his paralysis that Reeve really got moving as a public figure of the first rank. As his memoir <i>Still Me</i> details, since the accident, Reeve has directed his first film, started the Christopher Reeve Foundation to fund spinal-cord-repair research, lobbied Congress, and crisscrossed the country on speaking engagements.</p><p> Says Reeve, ""Lindbergh made it across the Atlantic [where he was feted by Reeve's grandma]; Houdini got out of those straitjackets; with enough money and grass-roots support, why shouldn't I be able to get out of this wheelchair?"" Part Hollywood reminiscence, part scientific detective story, and part soapbox speech, <i>Still Me</i> explains the tantalizing but quite real possiblity that Reeve (and a quarter-million other paralyzed people, plus 49 million disabled Americans) may get back on their feet. Bobby Kennedy once tried to bolster Reeve's faith by saying, ""Just fake it till you make it. The prayers will seem phony, but one day they'll become real."" Christopher Reeve has more than a prayer, he has a program. He ain't fake, and he just might make it, leading a cast of millions. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>",4.09,19.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.08100235425561629, 'Anticipation': 0.1674181663407951, 'Disgust': 0.048149182660973885, 'Fear': 0.15471582671614595, 'Joy': 0.09178936727717701, 'Sadness': 0.13306199539789582, 'Surprise': 0.07315483553462883, 'Trust': 0.25070827181676714}",en,2507,

Now the acclaimed author who illuminated the Civil War and the Mexican-American War brilliantly brings to life the American Revolution, creating a superb saga of the men who helped to forge the destiny of a nation.<br /><br />In 1770, the fuse of revolution is lit by a fateful command--""Fire!""--as England's peacekeeping mission ignites into the Boston Massacre. The senseless killing of civilians leads to a tumultuous trial in which lawyer John Adams must defend the very enemy who has assaulted and abused the laws he holds sacred.<br /><br />The taut courtroom drama soon broadens into a stunning epic of war as King George III leads a reckless and corrupt government in London toward the escalating abuse of his colonies. Outraged by the increasing loss of their liberties, an extraordinary gathering of America's most inspiring characters confronts the British presence with the ideals that will change history.<br /><br />John Adams, the idealistic attorney devoted to the law, who rises to greatness by the power of his words . . . Ben Franklin, one of the most celebrated men of his time, the elderly and audacious inventor and philosopher who endures firsthand the hostile prejudice of the British government . . . Thomas Gage, the British general given the impossible task of crushing a colonial rebellion without starting an all-out war . . . George Washington, the dashing Virginian whose battle experience in the French and Indian War brings him the recognition that elevates him to command of a colonial army . . . and many other immortal names from the Founding Family of the colonial struggle--Abigail Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Joseph Warren, Samuel Adams, Richard Henry Lee-- captured as never before in their full flesh-and-blood humanity.<br /><br />More than a powerful portrait of the people and purpose of the revolution, <i>Rise to Rebellion</i> is a vivid account of history's most pivotal events. The Boston Tea Party, the battles of Concord and Bunker Hill--all are recreated with the kind of breathtaking detail only a master like Jeff Shaara can muster. His most impressive achievement, <i>Rise to Rebellion</i> reveals with new immediacy how philosophers became fighters, ideas their ammunition, and how a scattered group of colonies became the United States of America.<br /><br />Length: 6 hrs and 1 min",4.19,17.0,,,"{'Anger': 0.16834136505007008, 'Anticipation': 0.11061553709969582, 'Disgust': 0.07126866946922315, 'Fear': 0.20543251649065242, 'Joy': 0.13759014320380056, 'Sadness': 0.08216275334085238, 'Surprise': 0.06440753272497352, 'Trust': 0.16018148262073212}",en,2485,
